# Background  
Intermittent-Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars (Intermittent-AMXPs), such as HETE J1900.1-2455, SAX J1748.9-2021, and Aql X-1, are a subset of Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) that exhibit sporadic X-ray pulsations during outbursts. These systems serve as unique laboratories for studying pulse phenomena, as most LMXBs lack persistent pulsations due to unresolved mechanisms such as weak magnetic fields, gravitational lensing, or Compton scattering. Aql X-1, with a 550.25 Hz pulse detected for only 150 s, has a 19-hour orbital period and cyclic outbursts. HETE J1900.1-2455, discovered in 2005, initially showed 377.3 Hz pulses but later exhibited sporadic pulsations. SAX J1748.9-2021, located in NGC 6440, displays transient 442.3 Hz pulsations, recently detected by XMM-Newton.  

# Motivation  
The absence of persistent pulsations in most LMXBs remains unexplained, necessitating detailed studies of intermittent-AMXPs to elucidate the physical conditions enabling sporadic pulsations. Understanding these systems could clarify the roles of magnetic field strength, accretion dynamics, and Compton scattering in suppressing or enabling pulsations.  

# Methodology  
The study analyzed 16 years of RXTE/PCA data in the \(3.0-13.0 \mathrm{keV}\) energy range for three intermittent-AMXPs. Temporal analysis utilized the \(Z_{n}^{2}\) statistic, which processes photon arrival times directly without requiring light curves. The phase \(\Phi(t)\) for each photon was calculated using \(\Phi(t)=2 \pi \cdot \nu \cdot t\), where \(\nu\) is the input frequency. The \(Z_{n}^{2}\) power was computed via:  
\[
Z_{n}^{2}=\frac{2}{N} \sum_{\mathrm{k}=1}^{n}\left[\left(\sum_{\mathrm{j}=1}^{N} \cos k \Phi_{\mathrm{j}}\right)^{2}+\left(\sum_{\mathrm{j}=1}^{N} \sin k \Phi_{\mathrm{j}}\right)^{2}\right]
\]  
The \(3.0-13.0 \mathrm{keV}\) range was selected as optimal for pulsations. Pulse scans used frequency ranges \(550.0-550.5 \mathrm{Hz}\) (Aql X-1), \(336.0-338.0 \mathrm{Hz}\) (HETE J1900.1-2455), and \(441.0-443.0 \mathrm{Hz}\) (SAX J1748.9-2021), with a \(10^{-4} \mathrm{Hz}\) step size. The maximum likelihood (ML) technique refined pulse profiles using phase shifts \(\phi_{\text{off}}\), calculated via \(\operatorname{Prob}(\phi_{\text{off}})=\prod_{i=1}^{N} P_{i}(\phi_{i}-\phi_{\text{off}})\), where \(P_i\) is the normalized pulse profile.  

# Results  
For Aql X-1, 45 out of 111 pulse candidates survived RMS elimination, with durations of 25–109 s. HETE J1900.1-2455 yielded 30 candidates (27–62 s), and SAX J1748.9-2021 showed 21 candidates (26–661 s). ML analysis revealed systematic phase shifts, confirming an \(8.764 \pm 0.001\)-hour orbital period for SAX J1748.9-2021. ML detected slightly longer pulse durations than \(Z_{1}^{2}\), indicating smoother transitions between pulse states. Simulations confirmed detections with chance probabilities of \(1 \times 10^{-5}\) to \(4 \times 10^{-5}\). Three transition patterns (sharp, smooth, intermediate) were linked to accretion regimes and magnetic field orientations.  

# Interpretation  
The longer pulse durations observed with ML suggest smooth transitions between pulse-on and pulse-off states, influenced by inhomogeneous Comptonized coronae and accretion rate variations. The corona’s optical depth may insufficiently suppress pulsations, while thick disc assumptions could explain transitions. Magnetic field strength variations and accretion turbulence likely modulate pulse amplitudes. Phase shift evolution in SAX J1748.9-2021 validated its orbital period, even in \(Z_{1}^{2}\)-null intervals, highlighting ML’s sensitivity.  

# Implication  
This study enhances understanding of intermittent-AMXP pulse dynamics, offering insights into orbital parameters and accretion physics. The ML technique’s precision in detecting phase shifts and pulse transitions underscores its utility for future studies of similar systems. The identified transition patterns provide a framework for linking observational data to theoretical models of accretion regimes and magnetic field interactions.
