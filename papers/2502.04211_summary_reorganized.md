# Background  
Neutron stars (NSs) provide a unique laboratory for studying matter at densities several times nuclear saturation density (\(n_{\text{sat}}\)). The equation of state (EOS) of NS matter remains uncertain, though constraints have emerged from radio observations of massive pulsars, the multimessenger event GW170817, and X-ray measurements by NICER. Direct EOS calculations from quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are impractical due to its strong coupling at nuclear densities. Effective field theories, particularly relativistic mean-field (RMF) models with density-dependent meson-baryon couplings, are widely used to describe nuclear matter and finite nuclei properties. Two specific RMF models—Typel-Wolter (TW) and Gogelein et al. (GDFM)—are studied here, with TW applied to finite nuclei and astrophysical simulations, and GDFM exploring NS crust properties and relativistic metamodelling.  

# Motivation  
This work systematically compares TW and GDFM models using a metamodelling approach to assess their ability to generate diverse NS compositions and implications for machine learning-based EOS inference. The study addresses the obscuration of composition information in \(\beta\)-equilibrium, necessitating observations of non-equilibrium phenomena to clarify high-density matter properties.  

# Methodology  
The Lagrangian density for both models includes nucleon and meson fields (\(\psi, \sigma, \omega_{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\rho}_{\mu}\)) with density-dependent couplings \(\Gamma_i(n_B)\). TW employs \(\Gamma_i(n_B) = \Gamma_i(n_{\text{sat}}) f_i(x)\), where \(f_i(x)\) is a rational function, while GDFM uses \(\Gamma_i(n_B) = a_i + (b_i + d_i x^3) e^{-c_i x}\) with \(x = n_B / n_0\). Parameters for nuclear empirical properties (e.g., \(n_{\text{sat}}\), \(E_{\text{sat}}\), \(K_{\text{sat}}\), \(E_{\text{sym}}\), \(L_{\text{sym}}\)) are constrained within specific ranges. A Bayesian analysis incorporates nuclear and astrophysical constraints, generating unified EOSs and solving Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. The crust-core junction is matched using a compressible liquid drop approach with nonrelativistic (NR) metamodelling. Nested Sampling (PyMultiNest) optimizes parameter sets, incorporating \(\chi\)-EFT constraints and astrophysical limits from pulsar masses, GW170817, and NICER.  

# Results  
Both models yield similar EOSs and NS mass-radius sequences but differ significantly in proton fractions at high densities. GDFM exhibits broader ranges for symmetry energy parameters (\(K_{\text{sym}}\), \(Q_{sym}^{*}\), \(Z_{sym}^{*}\)) due to its parametric freedom in \(\rho\)-meson coupling, while TW shows narrower ranges. Pearson correlations reveal distinct NMP interactions, with astrophysical constraints reducing prior correlations. GDFM’s pressure is stiffer at low densities but softer at high densities compared to TW. Proton fractions in GDFM reach up to \(\sim 0.45\) (priors) and \(\sim 0.3\) (posteriors), contrasting with TW’s saturation between 0.12–0.2. Mass-tidal deformability relations align with NICER observations, though TW explores lower radii and tidal deformability in priors. Both models converge in posteriors for \(M-R\) and \(M-\Lambda\) sequences, with GDFM exhibiting broader proton fraction variations due to isovector Lagrangian freedom.  

# Interpretation  
The results demonstrate that \(\beta\)-equilibrated EOSs alone cannot constrain NS composition, as composition information is obscured in equilibrium conditions. Differences in higher-order parameters (\(Q_{\text{sat}}^{*}\), \(Z_{\text{sat}}^{*}\), \(Q_{\text{sym}}^{*}\), \(Z_{\text{sym}}^{*}\)) between models highlight the influence of Lagrangian variations on NS cooling and transport behaviors. GDFM’s flexibility in the isovector sector enables exploration of diverse symmetry energy behaviors, challenging prior assumptions about EOS constraints.  

# Implication  
The study underscores the necessity of explicit symmetry energy information and non-equilibrium observations to resolve NS composition uncertainties.
