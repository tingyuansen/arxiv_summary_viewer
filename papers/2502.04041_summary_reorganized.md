# Background  
Black holes are pivotal in understanding gravity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics, offering insights into fundamental physics. Recent discoveries, such as gravitational waves from binary mergers and images of supermassive black holes, have underscored their significance. Hawking's revelation that black holes emit quasi-thermal radiation has spurred extensive research into Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics. Modifications to general relativity, motivated by cosmological and quantum challenges, have introduced various black hole metrics, affecting observables like Hawking radiation. Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), formed in the early Universe, are intriguing as potential dark matter candidates due to their small size and high temperature, making their Hawking radiation a valuable probe into the Standard Model and beyond. The computation of Hawking radiation involves solving Schrödinger-like wave equations for perturbing fields, with gray-body factors (GBFs) critically modifying the radiation spectrum as it propagates from the horizon to infinity.  

# Motivation  
Semi-analytical methods for computing GBFs are limited by approximations, highlighting the need for precise numerical tools. This work introduces a numerical tool to compute GBFs for spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black holes, handling a range of perturbing fields and metrics. The tool aims to provide accurate results for emission spectra, black hole evolution, and studies of quantum properties, particularly for PBHs and modified gravity scenarios.  

# Methodology  
The code focuses on spherically symmetric, static, asymptotically flat metrics of the form \(ds^{2}=-G(r)dt^{2}+\frac{dr^{2}}{F(r)}+H(r)d\Omega^{2}\), encompassing Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, Hayward, Bardeen, Simpson-Visser, Peltola-Kunstatter, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli metrics. Using the Newman-Penrose formalism, massless field equations reduce to a master equation for NP-scalars \(\Upsilon_{s}\). Under the ansatz \(\Upsilon_{s}(t,r,\theta,\varphi)=\Phi_{s}(r)S_{l,m}^{s}(\theta,\varphi)e^{-i\omega t}\), the radial equation in tortoise coordinates \(dr^{*}/dr=1/\sqrt{FG}\) becomes \(\partial_{r^{*}}Z_{s}+(\omega^{2}+V_{s}(r(r^{*})))Z_{s}=0\). Boundary conditions yield asymptotic solutions, with transmission coefficient \(T=1/|b|^{2}\) representing the GBF \(\Gamma_{s}^{l}(\omega)\). The emission rate is \(\frac{d^{2}N_{i}}{dtdE_{i}}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sum_{l,m}\frac{n_{i}\Gamma_{l,m}^{s}(\omega)}{e^{\omega/T}\pm 1}\), where \(T\) is the black hole temperature.  

The code GrayHawk.nb computes GBFs using numerical inversion of tortoise coordinates, sampling near-horizon and far-away regimes, and fitting asymptotic solutions. CalibratorGH.nb verifies sampling adequacy. Metrics include Schwarzschild (\(ds^{2}=-(1-2M/r)dt^{2}+\frac{dr^{2}}{1-2M/r}+r^{2}d\Omega^{2}\)), Reissner-Nordström (\(ds^{2}=-(1-2M/r+Q^{2}/r^{2})dt^{2}+\frac{dr^{2}}{1-2M/r+Q^{2}/r^{2}}+r^{2}d\Omega^{2}\)), Hayward (\(ds^{2}=\left(1-\frac{2Mr^{2}}{r^{3}+2M\ell^{2}}\right)dt^{2}+\frac{dr^{2}}{1-\frac{2Mr^{2}}{r^{3}+2M\ell^{2}}}+r^{2}d\Omega^{2}\)), Bardeen (\(ds^{2}=\left(1-\frac{2Mr^{2}}{(r^{2}+\ell^{2})^{3/2}}\right)dt^{2}+\frac{dr^{2}}{1-\frac{2Mr^{2}}{(r^{2}+\ell^{2})^{3/2}}}+r^{2}d\Omega^{2}\)), Simpson-Visser (\(ds^{2}=-\left(1-\frac{2M}{\sqrt{r^{2}+\ell^{2}}}\right)dt^{2}+\frac{dr^{2}}{1-\frac{2M}{\sqrt{r^{2}+\ell^{2}}}}+(r^{2}+\ell^{2})d\Omega^{2}\)), Peltola-Kunstatter (\(ds^{2}=-\left(\frac{r-2M}{\sqrt{r^{2}+\ell^{2}}}\right)dt^{2}+\frac{dr^{2}}{\frac{r-2M}{\sqrt{r^{2}+\ell^{2}}}}+(r^{2}+\ell^{2})d\Omega^{2}\)), and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli (\(ds^{2}=-\left(1-\frac{2M}{\sqrt{r^{2}+\ell^{2}}}\right)dt^{2}+\frac{dr^{2}}{\left(1-\frac{2M}{\sqrt{r^{2}+\ell^{2}}}\right)\left(1+\frac{\ell}{\sqrt{r^{2}+\ell^{2}}}\right)}+(r^{2}+\ell^{2})d\Omega^{2}\)). Modifications for new metrics, such as the Frolov BH (\(ds^{2}=\left(1-\frac{\left(2M-q^{2}\right)r^{2}}{r^{3}+2M\ell^{2}}\right)dt^{2}+\frac{dr^{2}}{1-\frac{\left(2M-q^{2}\right)r^{2}}{r^{3}+2M\ell^{2}}}+r^{2}d\Omega^{2}\)), involve adjusting parameters and sampling regions.  

# Results  
Validation against literature spectra for Hayward, Bardeen, Simpson-Visser, Peltola-Kunstatter, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli black holes shows excellent agreement, with residuals at spectral peaks below 1%. Computational times range from 7–10 seconds for Schwarzschild to longer durations for complex metrics. GBFs are computed up to \(l=4\), with energy ranges from 0 to 1 (in units of \(M=1\)). CalibratorGH.nb ensures sampling adequacy, addressing non-oscillatory or growing oscillations in solutions. The Frolov BH example demonstrates successful adaptation of the code for custom metrics.  

# Interpretation  
The tool’s accuracy in reproducing known spectra confirms its reliability for studying Hawking radiation across diverse black hole configurations. Precise GBF computation enables detailed modeling of emission spectra, critical for analyzing black hole evaporation, quantum gravity effects, and beyond-Standard-Model physics. The code’s flexibility to accommodate user-defined metrics enhances its utility in exploring modified gravity theories and regular black hole models.  

# Implication  
GrayHawk provides a foundation for advancing research in black hole thermodynamics, primordial black holes, and quantum gravity. Future extensions will include additional metrics, fields, and functionality, facilitating studies of black hole-to-white hole transitions, information paradox resolutions, and high-energy physics signatures. By overcoming semi-analytical limitations, the tool supports accurate predictions for observational signatures of black holes in gravitational wave and quantum gravity frameworks.
