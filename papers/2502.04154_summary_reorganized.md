# Background  
Blazars, a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with jets aligned toward Earth, exhibit a two-bump spectral energy distribution (SED). The low-energy bump originates from synchrotron emission, while the high-energy bump’s origin is debated: leptonic models attribute it to inverse Compton (IC) scattering (synchrotron self-Compton or external inverse Compton involving photons from the broad-line region (BLR), accretion disk, or dusty torus), and hadronic models propose proton-photon interactions or proton synchrotron emission. Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), a blazar subclass dominated by external inverse Compton (EIC) processes, exhibit \(\gamma\)-ray emission arising from interactions of high-energy leptons/hadrons in the jet with ambient photon fields. The \(\gamma\)-ray emission region’s location along the jet remains uncertain, with studies suggesting positions near the BLR, beyond it, or near the dusty torus.  

# Motivation  
Internal \(\gamma-\gamma\) absorption, influenced by the BLR’s Ly \(\alpha\) photons, can constrain the \(\gamma\)-ray emission region’s location. For high-redshift \((z \gtrsim 3)\) sources, redshift shifts absorption features to lower energies, enhancing detectability. This study aims to search for these absorption features in Fermi-LAT data from nine high-redshift FSRQs to locate the \(\gamma\)-ray emission region relative to the supermassive black hole (SMBH).  

# Methodology  
The analysis uses Fermi-LAT data from nine high-redshift \((z \gtrsim 3)\) FSRQs (Paliya et al. 2020), covering MJD 54683 to MJD 59794 (August 4, 2008, to August 4, 2022). Photons between 100 MeV and 300 GeV were analyzed using Fermi Science Tools \(11-05-03\) and FERMIPY 1.0.1 with PASS 8 IRFs. Backgrounds were modeled using isotropic and Galactic diffuse templates, with 4FGL-DR4 sources within \(20^{\circ}\) included. The BLR photon field (dominated by Ly \(\alpha\), C IV, Mg II, and H \(\beta\) lines) was modeled using direct measurements or scaling relations (Finke 2016), with line luminosities derived from C IV or Mg II data. Internal \(\gamma-\gamma\) opacity was modeled using Böttcher \& Els (2016)'s code, integrating angle-dependent cross-sections for interactions between \(\gamma\)-rays and BLR photons. The BLR was modeled as a shell with radii \(R_{1} = 0.9 R_{\mathrm{BLR}}\) and \(R_{2} = 1.1 R_{\mathrm{BLR}}\), where \(R_{\mathrm{BLR}} \simeq 0.1\left(L_{\mathrm{D}, 46}\right)^{1 / 2} \mathrm{pc}\) (derived from disk luminosity \(L_{\mathrm{D}}\)). A composite spectral model incorporating intrinsic emission, internal absorption, and extragalactic background light (EBL) attenuation was used:  
\[
\frac{d N}{d E}=\frac{d N_{\text {intrinsic }}}{d E} \times \exp \left(-\tau_{\gamma-\gamma}\right) \times \exp \left(-\tau_{\text {EBL }}\right)
\]  
Binned likelihood analysis with FERMIPY tested variations in Test Statistic (TS) to constrain the emission region’s distance \(d\) from the SMBH.  

# Results  
A hint of internal \(\gamma-\gamma\) absorption was found in 4FGL J0733.8+0455 (Source 3, \(z=3.01\)), yielding \(d \geq 0.88 R_{\text {BLR}}\) with a TS improvement. For other sources, limited high-energy photon statistics (\(\gtrsim 5-6 \mathrm{GeV}\)) resulted in insignificant TS variations (\(\Delta \mathrm{TS} < 4\)), preventing distance constraints. The best-fit model for Source 3 suggests \(d / R_{\text{BLR}}=0.95_{-0.02}^{+0.09}\) (corresponding to \(d=0.19_{-0.004}^{+0.018} \mathrm{pc}\)), with a global TS maximum at \(d \approx 0.95 R_{\text{BLR}}\) (\(\mathrm{TS}_{\text{bf}}-\mathrm{TS}_0 \approx 3\), \(1.7 \sigma\)).  

# Interpretation  
The detection of mild internal \(\gamma-\gamma\) opacity in Source 3 implies the \(\gamma\)-ray emitting region is located near the BLR’s inner boundary or within its central portion. The TS curve’s drop at \(d \approx 0.93 R_{\text{BLR}}\) (\(\approx 4 \sigma\) significance) rules out smaller distances. These results are independent of \(\gamma\)-ray production mechanisms but assume GeV emission occurs near the BLR. The one-zone emission model used may not capture multi-zone complexities, necessitating further studies.  

# Implication  
High-redshift sources’ faintness limits photon statistics, but targeting intermediate-redshift \((z \sim 1-3)\) blazars with harder spectra could improve detectability of absorption features. The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), with a low energy threshold (\(\sim 10 \mathrm{GeV}\)), combined with Fermi-LAT, will enable continuous energy coverage for deeper exploration of internal \(\gamma-\gamma\) opacity. This promises precise constraints on \(\gamma\)-ray emitting regions and blazar environments, advancing understanding of jet physics and AGN structure.
