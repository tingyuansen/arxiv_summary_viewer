# Background  
Solar quiescent prominences are cool, dense structures (\(\mathrm{T}<2 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~K}\), \(10^{9}<\mathrm{n}_{e}<10^{11} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}\)) suspended in the hot corona, lasting days to months. They consist of a spine, bubbles, and legs (barbs). Counterstreaming flows, first observed in active regions, are prevalent in quiescent prominences, with velocities of 8 to 15 \(\mathrm{km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\). Prominences also exhibit periodic mass movements and oscillations, often triggered by wave or jet interactions. Despite advancements in observational capabilities, the driving mechanism of counterstreaming flows remains unclear. Simulations suggest turbulent heating at the solar surface may play a role.  

# Motivation  
This study aims to elucidate the dynamics of counterstreaming flows, oscillations, and mass injections in solar quiescent prominences, leveraging high-resolution data from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST), Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to analyze a prominence observed on 2016 August 17. The unclear driving mechanisms of counterstreaming flows and the interplay between oscillations and mass injections motivate this investigation.  

# Methodology  
NVST observed the prominence on 2016 August 17 using \(\mathrm{H} \alpha\) line-center and off-band images at \(6562.8 \AA, 6562.8 \pm 0.4 \AA\), and \(6562.8 \pm 0.7 \AA\), with a spatial resolution of \(0.^{\prime \prime} 3\) and cadence of \(\sim 76 \mathrm{~s}\). Data were calibrated and coaligned with an accuracy of \(0.^{\prime \prime} 1\). SDO/AIA provided EUV images at \(304 \AA, 171 \AA\), and \(211 \AA\) with a 12 s cadence. IRIS captured Mg II h 2803.5 spectra with 5 large coarse raster scans. Dopplergrams were constructed to analyze Doppler shift signals, and velocities were derived from linear fits to time-distance diagrams. Gauss fitting profiles at asterisk points in Figs. 4a and 4d (marked by black circles) were used to denote peak intensity, Doppler velocity, and line width.  

# Results  
The prominence exhibited emissive structures in \(304 \AA\) and \(\mathrm{H} \alpha\), absorptive structures in \(211 \AA\), and mixed features in \(171 \AA\). The spine, nearly parallel to the limb, included bubbles and legs (barbs). Counterstreaming flows dominated the central spine, with velocities of 4 to 11 \(\mathrm{km} \mathrm{s}^{-1}\), confirmed by \(\mathrm{H} \alpha\) center and off-band images and Dopplergrams. Longitudinal oscillations in the spine had an 83-minute period and 32 Mm amplitude, with velocities of 11 to 17 \(\mathrm{km} \mathrm{s}^{-1}\). Transverse oscillations of threads perpendicular to the spine showed periods of 12 to 17 minutes and amplitudes of ~3 Mm. Doppler signals revealed alternating blueshifts and redshifts, with randomness in the lower spine due to mass injections. Two types of mass injections were identified: upward plumes from bubble boundaries (velocities of 22 to 30 \(\mathrm{km} \mathrm{s}^{-1}\), redshifted Doppler signals) and tornado-like barbs (velocities of 6 to 15 \(\mathrm{km} \mathrm{s}^{-1}\), redshifted signals). Blueshifted signals in another region indicated upward mass flows at 5 to 11 \(\mathrm{km} \mathrm{s}^{-1}\).  

# Interpretation  
The upper spine’s longitudinal oscillations align with simulations of prominence dynamics, while the lower spine’s irregularity stems from intermittent mass injections. Counterstreaming flows arise from the interplay between longitudinal oscillations and mass injections, with blueshifted and redshifted Doppler signals reflecting injection sites on opposite sides of the spine. The coexistence of unidirectional flows in \(\mathrm{H} \alpha \pm 0.4 \AA\) images and alternating Doppler velocities in Mg II h \(2803.5 \AA\) observations corroborate these dynamics.  

# Implication  
The findings support both chromospheric evaporation-coronal condensation and direct injection models of prominence formation and sustenance. The simultaneous existence of oscillations, counterstreaming flows, and mass injections highlights their ongoing role in prominence dynamics, advancing the understanding of how these structures remain suspended in the corona. The study demonstrates the necessity of multi-instrument observations to unravel complex solar phenomena.
