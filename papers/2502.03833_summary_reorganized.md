# Background  
The rotating carousel model explains subpulse drifting as subbeams rotating relative to the line of sight due to \(\boldsymbol{E} \times \boldsymbol{B}\) drift, inferring pulsar parameters like \(\zeta\) and \(\alpha\). However, observations of pulsars such as PSR J0815+0939 reveal bi-drifting subpulses with opposite drift directions across different profile components, challenging the traditional assumption of a singular emission state. These phenomena suggest coexisting emission states with distinct properties, as seen in pulsars exhibiting nulling or phase-dependent emission changes. For example, PSR J1819+1305 shows pulse disappearance in one component while drift patterns change in others, indicating simultaneous operation of different emission states.  

# Motivation  
The singular emission state assumption in the carousel model fails to explain opposite drift directions and drift-rate switching. This motivates exploring a modified model where plasma flow rates (and thus drift rates) depend on multiple emission states. Understanding these states, parameterized by \(y\), could elucidate mechanisms behind coexisting drift patterns, non-uniform subpulse distributions, and deviations from corotation. The study aims to determine \(y\) from drift parameters, providing insights into emission region properties and the relationship between drifting and non-drifting subpulses.  

# Methodology  
The model assumes emission from \(m\) discrete overdense plasma areas influenced by \(\boldsymbol{E} \times \boldsymbol{B}\) drift, with the electric field given by:  
\[
\boldsymbol{E}=(1-y \boldsymbol{b} \boldsymbol{b}) \cdot \boldsymbol{E}_{\mathrm{ind}}+(1-y) \boldsymbol{E}_{\mathrm{pot}},
\]  
where \(y \in [0,1]\) represents the emission state. Plasma flow rate is:  
\[
\boldsymbol{v}_{\mathrm{dr}}=\frac{\boldsymbol{E} \times \boldsymbol{B}}{B^{2}}=y \boldsymbol{v}_{\mathrm{ind}}+(1-y) \boldsymbol{v}_{\mathrm{cor}},
\]  
with angular velocity \(\boldsymbol{\omega}_{\mathrm{dr}}=y \boldsymbol{\omega}_{\mathrm{ind}}+(1-y) \boldsymbol{\omega}_{\mathrm{cor}}\). Simulations for PSRs B0525+21, B1929+10, and B0052+51 divide profiles into regions A and B, varying \(m\) (1–45) and \(y\) (0–1) to match observed \(P_2\), \(P_3\), and drift rates. Charge density \(\rho_{\mathrm{sn}}\) is derived using:  
\[
\rho_{\mathrm{sn}}=y \rho_{\min }+(1-y) \rho_{\mathrm{GJ}},
\]  
with \(\rho_{\mathrm{GJ}}=-\varepsilon_{0} \operatorname{div} \boldsymbol{E}_{\mathrm{cor}}\). The visible point’s trajectory depends on \(\zeta\) and \(\alpha\), with emission spots aligned along radial spokes proportional to \(\cos(m\phi_b)\).  

# Results  
Simulations reveal opposite drift directions in all three pulsars, driven by varying \(y\) and \(m\). For PSR B0525+21, \(\omega_{\mathrm{dr}}/\omega_{\text{cor}}\) averages 0.98 (region A) and 1.05 (region B). PSR B0052+51 shows \(\omega_{\mathrm{dr}}/\omega_{\text{cor}}=0.93\) and 1.05, while PSR B1929+10 exhibits 1.14 and 0.89. Drift rate \(P_2/P_3\) reflects these changes, with \(y\) values averaging 0.24, 0.62, and 0.58. Subpulse numbers \(m\) vary (e.g., \(28 \pm 3\) for PSR B0525+21) but show no correlation with \(y\) or \(\alpha\). Charge density \(\rho_{\mathrm{sn}}\) deviates from the Goldreich-Julian value, with non-uniform distribution across emission regions.  

# Interpretation  
Opposite drifting arises from coexisting emission states operating concurrently, where \(y\) varies with azimuthal (\(\phi_b\)) and polar (\(\theta_b\)) angles but not obliquity (\(\alpha\)). Subpulse distribution uniformity depends on pulsar-specific \(D_A/D_B\) ratios: near 1 for PSR B0525+21 (uniform) and unequal for others (non-uniform). Emission states correlate with plasma density \(\rho_{\mathrm{sn}}\) and height \(r\), as \(y\) increases at lower heights in PSRs B1929+10 and B0052+51. Drift-mode switching (e.g., PSR B0031-07) implies time-dependent \(y\), suggesting opposite drifting and mode switching share the same mechanism.  

# Implication  
The findings advance understanding of pulsar emission mechanisms by linking opposite drifting to coexisting states in the rotating carousel model. Non-uniform subpulse distributions and \(m\)-independence from \(\alpha\) highlight pulsar-dependent carousel structures. Future telescopes like FAST and SKA may detect more complex drifting patterns, revealing broader prevalence of multiple emission states. The model’s ability to derive emission region properties (e.g., charge density, plasma flow) from \(y\) and \(m\) underscores the role of \(\boldsymbol{E} \times \boldsymbol{B}\) drift in shaping observable subpulse behavior.
