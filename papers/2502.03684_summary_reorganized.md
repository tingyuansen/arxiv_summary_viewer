# Background  
Quasars, powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs), are critical for understanding SMBH growth. Reliable SMBH mass measurements often rely on broad emission lines like \(\mathrm{H} \beta\) and Mg II, using the virial assumption and the radius-luminosity (\(R-L\)) relation. While reverberation mapping (RM) provides robust mass estimates, single-epoch methods calibrated against RM are more practical but less precise. Recent evidence suggests scatter in the \(R-L\) relation due to accretion states and iron emission, necessitating corrections for improved accuracy.  

# Motivation  
Canonical single-epoch SMBH mass measurements may overestimate masses, particularly for high-redshift quasars, creating tensions in early SMBH growth scenarios. This study aims to address these overestimations by incorporating iron emission strength as a tracer of the Eddington ratio, recalibrating \(\mathrm{H} \beta\)- and Mg II-based \(R-L\) relations using a large DESI quasar sample. The goal is to reconcile discrepancies in SMBH mass-growth history and provide more reliable estimators for high-redshift populations.  

# Methodology  
We analyze over 55,000 DESI quasars (\(0.25<z<0.8\)) with high signal-to-noise ratios (\(\mathrm{TSNR}_{\mathrm{QSO}}>25\)) and robust spectral fits. Spectral fitting using DASpec models power-law continua, Fe II pseudo-continua, and emission lines (\(\mathrm{H} \beta\), Mg II, [O III]) across optical (3750–5500 Å) and UV (2200–4260 Å) windows. The iron-corrected \(R-L\) relation for \(\mathrm{H} \beta\) is \(\log \left(R_{\mathrm{H} \beta} / \mathrm{ltd}\right)=1.65+0.45 \log l_{44}-0.35 R_{\mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{H} \beta}\), where \(R_{\mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{H} \beta}\) quantifies iron strength. A combined \(\mathrm{H} \beta\)-Mg II sample (\(0.65<z<0.8\)) calibrates Mg II-based masses using the relation \(\log \left(R_{\mathrm{Mg}_{\text{II}}} / \mathrm{ltd}\right) \sim 0.46 \log l_{44}-0.34 R_{\mathrm{Fe}}\). Systematic uncertainties (e.g., Fe II template choice, host galaxy contamination) are propagated into error estimates, with virial \(f\)-factor scatter (\(\sim 0.3\) dex) identified as a major limitation.  

# Results  
Iron-corrected \(\mathrm{H} \beta\)-based SMBH masses reduce canonical estimates by 0.16 dex (factor of 1.5) on average, reaching 0.7 dex (factor of 5) for super-Eddington quasars. The super-Eddington fraction rises from \(0.4\%\) to \(\sim 5\%\). Mg II masses calibrated against iron-corrected \(\mathrm{H} \beta\) masses show similar corrections, with a mean offset of 0.03 dex and scatter of 0.24 dex. Applying this to \(\sim 0.5\) million DESI quasars (\(0.6<z<1.6\)), we predict high-redshift (\(z \geq 6\)) SMBH mass overestimations by a factor of 2.3. Both \(R_{\mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{H} \beta}\) and \(R_{\mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{Mg} \text{II}}\) anti-correlate with \(\mathrm{FWHM}\) and [O III] equivalent width, consistent with Eigenvector 1 trends.  

# Interpretation  
The overestimation arises because canonical \(R-L\) relations neglect iron emission’s dependence on accretion states. Iron strength (\(R_{\mathrm{Fe}}\)) reliably traces the Eddington ratio, with stronger Fe II emission indicating higher accretion rates. This correction aligns \(\mathrm{FWHM}_{\mathrm{H} \beta}\) and \(\mathrm{FWHM}_{\mathrm{Fe}}\) kinematics, suggesting Fe II originates in intermediate-width regions inflowing toward the SMBH. Discrepancies between Mg II and \(\mathrm{H} \beta\) masses stem from the sub-linear \(\mathrm{FWHM}_{\mathrm{Mg} \text{II}}\)-\(\mathrm{FWHM}_{\mathrm{H} \beta}\) relation. Systematic uncertainties (\(\sim 0.4\)–0.5 dex) dominate over measurement errors, emphasizing the need for iron-corrected calibrations.  

# Implication  
Current high-redshift (\(z \geq 6\)) SMBH mass estimates may be overestimated by \(\sim 0.4\) dex, alleviating tensions in massive seed formation scenarios. JWST observations of high-Eddington AGNs in the early universe could benefit from iron-corrected \(R-L\) relations, potentially reducing inferred masses and easing growth challenges. Future reverberation mapping and interferometric studies will refine virial \(f\)-factors and iron templates, enabling more precise SMBH mass estimators across cosmic time.
