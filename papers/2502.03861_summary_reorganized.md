# Background  
Open clusters (OCs) are gravitationally bound stellar populations crucial for studying star formation, stellar evolution, and Galactic dynamics. They are classified by age into young (\(<10^6\) yr), intermediate-age (\(10^6-10^7\) yr), and old (\(>10^7\) yr), providing insights into coeval stellar systems. The Gaia mission, particularly Gaia DR3, has significantly expanded the census of OCs, enabling precise determinations of their fundamental parameters (distance, age, metallicity, reddening) and identification of variable stars.  

# Motivation  
This study focuses on the intermediate-age OC UPK 220 to leverage Gaia DR3 for membership analysis and TESS photometry to detect variable stars. By integrating these datasets, the research aims to constrain cluster and stellar parameters, enhancing understanding of stellar evolution and Galactic structure through the characterization of variable stars and their properties.  

# Methodology  
The study employs Gaia DR3 and TESS data for membership analysis and variability detection in UPK 220. The pyUPMASK algorithm, utilizing Gaia DR3 parameters (\(\mu_{\alpha}\), \(\mu_{\delta}\), \(\varpi\), and photometric bands), distinguishes 163 cluster members from field stars within a 30-arcmin radius. A King profile fit to the radial density profile yields core radius \(R_c=5.751 \pm 1.079\) arcmin and cluster limit radius \(R_{\mathrm{lim}}=24.0\) arcmin. TESS data spanning 124.29 days across five sectors are analyzed using lightkurve and TESScut to extract light curves, identifying eight variable stars. Variability classification is based on periodograms and light curve shapes, with eclipsing binaries modeled using JKTEBOP. Stellar atmospheric parameters (\(T_{\text{eff}}\), \(\log g\), \([Fe/H]\)) are derived using GSP-Phot, GSP-Spec, and SED fitting via the ARIADNE package. The MESA code and Metalcode tool are used to model variable stars and iteratively refine metallicity, age, and reddening through isochrone fitting.  

# Results  
The median parallax and proper motion values for UPK 220 are \(\varpi=1.03 \pm 0.03\) mas and \(\left(\mu_{\alpha}, \mu_{\delta}\right)=(-2.41 \pm 0.11,-2.64 \pm 0.12)\) mas/yr. Eight variable stars are identified: three eclipsing binaries (IDs 29, 67, 116), two pulsating (IDs 49, 138), two magnetic active (IDs 16, 42), and one rotating (ID 147). The best-fit cluster parameters include \(d=832\) pc, \(E(G_{BP}-G_{RP})=1.10\) mag, \(t=200\) Myr, and \(Z=0.005\), with Gaia DR3 \([Fe/H]=-0.57\). MIST isochrone fitting yields \([Fe/H]=-0.56\), \(DM_0=9.6\) mag, and age \(140\) Myr. TESS light curves reveal variability patterns, with eclipsing binaries showing orbital parameters and pulsating stars exhibiting periods from 0.6663 to 2.857 days. Spectral properties from GSP-Phot, SED, and MESA models indicate \(T_{\text{eff}}\) ranges of 4600–11481 K for binaries and 4419–8577 K for single stars, with masses between 0.6 \(M_{\odot}\) and 3.2 \(M_{\odot}\).  

# Interpretation  
Stars with membership probabilities \(P \geq 0.725\) confirm UPK 220’s mean proper motions and structural parameters (\(R_c=5.751 \pm 1.079\) arcmin, \(R_{\mathrm{lim}}=24.0\) arcmin), aligning with prior studies. Discrepancies in age, metallicity, and reddening with literature values arise from differing isochrones and photometric data. Variable stars near the main sequence (MS) or binary sequence (BS) suggest a coeval population, while deviations in IDs 16 and 29 imply potential membership uncertainties or an older cluster age. Binary systems influence cluster dynamics, with mass segregation and energy regulation effects. Metallicity discrepancies (\([Fe/H]=-0.56\) vs. solar) affect distance modulus calculations, highlighting the sensitivity of parameter determinations to input assumptions.  

# Implication  
This study provides the first metallicity determination for UPK 220, establishing a benchmark for future analyses. The identification of eight variable stars, including T-Tauri candidates and pulsating variables, enhances understanding of pre-main-sequence evolution and stellar activity in intermediate-age clusters. Discrepancies in derived parameters underscore the impact of methodological choices (e.g., isochrone models, photometric bands) on cluster characterization. The results emphasize the need for spectral observations to confirm binary components and accretion disks, particularly for outliers like IDs 29 and 67. These findings contribute to broader insights into stellar evolution, binary interactions, and Galactic dynamics through the lens of open cluster studies.
