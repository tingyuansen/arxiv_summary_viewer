# Background  
Symbiotic stars, consisting of a cool giant and a compact accretor (typically a white dwarf or neutron star), are ideal for studying mass transfer mechanisms. The dominant process—Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF), stellar wind, or a combination—remains unclear. Radii inferred from spectral types or rotational velocities suggest low Roche-lobe filling factors, but ellipsoidal variability in many systems implies near-full Roche lobes. Interferometric observations combined with Gaia distances offer a potential resolution to this discrepancy. Previous studies have highlighted contradictions between observational signatures and theoretical predictions, particularly regarding evolutionary states and mass transfer efficiency.  

# Motivation  
This study aims to resolve the ambiguity surrounding mass transfer mechanisms in symbiotic binaries by leveraging high-precision interferometric data and Gaia DR3 distances. The persistent contradiction between Roche-lobe filling factors derived from ellipsoidal variability and those inferred from spectral or rotational properties necessitates a direct observational approach. Understanding whether these systems transfer mass via wind, RLOF, or hybrid mechanisms is critical for modeling binary evolution and accretion physics.  

# Methodology  
Archival VLTI/PIONIER data (2012–2019) for six symbiotic stars (AG Peg, FG Ser, ER Del, V1261 Ori, RW Hya, and V399 Pav) were reduced using pndrs, yielding squared visibilities and closure phases. Angular diameters were derived using PMOIRED, testing uniform disk and limb-darkened models. The latter employed Claret & Southworth’s power-2 law for limb darkening, providing marginally better fits (reduced \(\chi^{2}\) values). Assumptions included negligible \(H\)-band contributions from companions or circumstellar material. Gaia DR3 parallaxes were used to convert angular to linear radii, with evolutionary tracks from MIST models constraining masses and evolutionary states.  

# Results  
All giants except possibly V399 Pav remain within their Roche lobes, even in systems exhibiting ellipsoidal variability. AG Peg’s M3 giant has \(R_{\mathrm{G}}=151.3_{-7.9}^{+8.7} \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\), filling \(\approx 0.56\) of its Roche lobe at 800 pc. FG Ser’s M5 giant (\(R_{\mathrm{G}}=157.1_{-12.8}^{+14.8} \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\); \(L_{\mathrm{G}}=2959_{-744}^{+1019} \mathrm{L}_{\odot}\)) resides on the AGB with a mass of \(2.0 \pm 0.3 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\). ER Del’s S5.5/2.5 donor (\(R_{\mathrm{G}}=141.5_{-8.9}^{+9.9} \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\)) shows incomplete circularization (\(e=0.28\)). V1261 Ori’s S4.1 giant has conflicting radius estimates: \(R_{\mathrm{G}}=97.8_{-4.5}^{+5.0} \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\) (Gaia) versus \(130.6_{-55.2}^{+96.3} \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\) (Hipparcos), filling 50–75% of its Roche lobe. RW Hya’s M2 giant (\(R_{\mathrm{G}}=106.5_{-7.0}^{+7.8} \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\)) may lie at the RGB tip. V399 Pav’s M5 giant (\(R_{\mathrm{G}}=197.4_{-35.7}^{+48.4} \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\)) could fill its Roche lobe for masses below \(\approx 2.10 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\) at \(i=90^{\circ}\). Rotation is not synchronized in any system, with \(v_{\text{rot}} \sin i\) measurements significantly below synchronized predictions.  

# Interpretation  
The absence of Roche-lobe overflow challenges traditional explanations for ellipsoidal variability, suggesting modified Roche-lobe dynamics influenced by stellar winds, pulsations, or transient mass transfer. Evolutionary tracks and Gaia astrometry indicate most giants are luminous AGB stars, though RW Hya may occupy the RGB tip. Discrepancies in mass ratios derived from He II lines (e.g., AG Peg’s \(q \approx 3\) versus Kenyon et al.’s \(q \approx 4\)) imply overestimations due to line formation mechanisms. The lack of synchronization (\(v_{\text{rot}} \sin i \ll v_{\text{sync}}\)) and circularization in systems like ER Del points to complex mass transfer histories. Gaia’s astrometric limitations for binaries with orbital periods near one year (e.g., RW Hya) exacerbate uncertainties in distance and radius estimates.  

# Implication  
These results highlight the limitations of Gaia’s single-star astrometric model for symbiotic binaries, particularly systems with orbital periods close to one year, where parallax deviations up to 1–2 mas can occur. This necessitates cautious interpretation of Gaia data in binary studies. The findings suggest mass transfer predominantly occurs via stellar wind or wind-RLOF rather than classical RLOF, requiring revised models for symbiotic binary evolution. The unresolved cause of ellipsoidal variability in underfilled systems calls for investigations into modified Roche-lobe geometries, dense winds, or transient accretion episodes. Future studies should prioritize spectroscopic follow-up to refine mass ratios and binary parameters, addressing discrepancies in He II line diagnostics.
