# Background  
The detection of RR Lyrae stars in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) is crucial for understanding their distance, metallicity, age, and properties of old stellar populations. Aquarius III, a newly discovered UFD, shares similarities with Virgo III in stellar mass, half-light radius \(r_h\), and absolute \(V\)-band magnitude \(M_V\). Both are expected to host \(1 \pm 1\) RR Lyrae based on empirical relations, making their study valuable for UFDs with \(M_V \gtrsim -5.0\) mag.  

# Motivation  
Studying RR Lyrae populations in UFDs like Aquarius III and Virgo III provides insights into their stellar populations and evolutionary histories. The empirical expectation of hosting \(1 \pm 1\) RR Lyrae in such systems motivates targeted searches to validate models and understand the demographics of variable stars in low-luminosity UFDs.  

# Methodology  
Time-series observations of Aquarius III were conducted using the Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) from 06 November to 07 December 2024, collecting 64 \(r\)-band images with 600-second exposures. The median seeing was \(1.26^{\prime \prime}\), reaching a depth of \(r \sim 22.0\) mag. The Princeton Instruments SOPHIA 2048B CCD camera provided a \(13.1^{\prime} \times 13.1^{\prime}\) field-of-view (FOV). Detected sources were cross-matched with the SDSS DR16 catalog, and magnitudes were calibrated to the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) AB system. Archival data from the PS1 \(3 \pi\) RR Lyrae Catalog and Gaia DR3 RR Lyrae Catalog were used to search for RR Lyrae within \(16 r_h\) of Aquarius III. Synthetic color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) were generated using the BaSTI tool with \(\alpha\)-enhanced models, \(Y = 0.247\), a 13 Gyr age, \(-2.4\) dex metallicity, and the Kroupa initial mass function.  

# Results  
A candidate RR Lyrae (SDSS DR16 objID 1237679433443508701) was detected \(\sim 4 r_h\) from Aquarius III’s center but was \(\gtrsim 1\) mag fainter than expected. Combining LOT and archival data, it was identified as a background halo star at \(\sim 163\) kpc. Another ab-type RR Lyrae (PS1 ID 103753576326015348, Gaia DR3 ID 2447369809479339136) was found \(\sim 25^{\prime}\) (\(\sim 15.6 r_h\)) from Aquarius III’s center. Its proper motion \((\mu_{\alpha *}, \mu_{\delta}) = (0.923 \pm 0.637, -0.549 \pm 0.565)\) mas yr\(^{-1}\) and photometric metallicity (\(-2.38 \pm 0.39\) dex) align with Aquarius III’s properties. Period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relations yielded a distance of \(87.9 \pm 5.7\) kpc, consistent with Aquarius III’s distance (\(85 \pm 4\) kpc). Synthetic CMDs for UFDs with \(\sim 2000 M_{\odot}\) stellar mass showed a \(\sim 50\%\) probability of hosting at least one RR Lyrae.  

# Interpretation  
The RR Lyrae Aquarius III-V1, with matching distance, proper motion, and metallicity, is the first confirmed variable star associated with Aquarius III. The background candidate’s exclusion demonstrates the importance of multi-band photometry and distance validation. Synthetic CMDs confirm that UFDs with \(M_V \gtrsim -5.0\) mag have a non-negligible probability of hosting RR Lyrae, supporting empirical predictions.  

# Implication  
This study highlights the feasibility of identifying RR Lyrae in low-luminosity UFDs and underscores the need for wide-field surveys to account for extended stellar populations. The detection of Aquarius III-V1 encourages similar searches in newly discovered UFDs, advancing our understanding of their old stellar components and evolutionary pathways.
