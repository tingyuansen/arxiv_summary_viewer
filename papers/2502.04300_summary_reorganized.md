# Background  
The cosmic microwave background (CMB) provides critical insights into the early Universe, particularly through \(B\)-mode polarization, which may reveal primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) generated during inflation. The tensor-to-scalar ratio \(r\) quantifies the amplitude of PGWs, distinguishing between inflationary models and probing energy scales beyond particle physics. Experiments like CMB-S4 aim to constrain \(r \leq 0.001\) or detect \(r \geq 0.003\) at \(5 \sigma\), testing models such as Starobinsky and Higgs inflation. Key challenges include isolating faint PGW signals from lensing-induced \(B\)-modes and Galactic foregrounds. Recent advances in component-separation methods, ranging from parametric to non-parametric approaches, have improved foreground mitigation, necessitating comparative evaluations under realistic observing conditions.  

# Motivation  
This study evaluates three foreground-cleaning pipelines for CMB-S4 to ensure robust inference of \(r\). The motivation arises from the need to validate methods against increasingly complex Galactic foregrounds and instrumental noise, which can introduce biases or inflate uncertainties. By testing parametric (model-based) and non-parametric (e.g., internal linear combination) approaches across simulated foreground suites, the work identifies pipeline-specific strengths and limitations. The goal is to inform strategies for achieving CMB-S4’s sensitivity targets while minimizing systematic errors from residual foreground contamination.  

# Methodology  
Three pipelines are compared: (A) a parametric cross-spectrum method fitting auto- and cross-power spectra of multi-frequency maps; (B) a harmonic-space internal linear combination (ILC) approach assuming statistical independence between CMB and contaminants; and (C) a parametric map-based method estimating spectral parameters via likelihood and reconstructing components with least-squares. Simulations combine lensed CMB, Galactic dust/synchrotron (with three complexity levels: Gaussian, isotropic, and non-Gaussian), and instrumental noise. Delensing is implemented iteratively using a lensing template derived from \(E\)-mode maps, achieving 92% efficiency. Foreground models include spatially varying spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and frequency decorrelation. Power spectra are computed using pseudo-\(C_{\ell}\) estimators, with likelihoods approximated via the Hamimeche-Lewis framework. Noise properties follow CMB-S4 Small Aperture Telescope specifications, incorporating \(1/f\) noise and hit-map scaling.  

# Results  
For simple foregrounds (Model 0), all pipelines yield unbiased \(r\) estimates with \(\sigma(r) \simeq 3 \times 10^{-4}\). Intermediate complexity (Model 1) slightly increases \(\sigma(r)\) by 13%, while highly non-Gaussian foregrounds (Model 2) introduce \(1.6-1.9 \sigma\) biases. Marginalizing over residuals reduces biases to \(\lesssim 0.1 \sigma\) but inflates \(\sigma(r)\) by 29–100%. For \(r=0.003\), \(\sigma(r)\) ranges \(5.2-5.8 \times 10^{-4}\), corresponding to \(5 \sigma\) detections in simple cases. Complex foregrounds reduce detection significances to \(2-4 \sigma\), with Pipeline C’s significance dropping to \(1.8 \sigma\) due to inflexible dust modeling. Delensing reduces \(\sigma(r)\) by factors of 10 (\(r=0\)) and 6 (\(r=0.003\)). PySM models confirm Pipeline A’s robustness, while Pipelines B and C exhibit biases in high-complexity scenarios. Cross-pipeline correlations decrease with foreground complexity, reflecting method-dependent sensitivities.  

# Interpretation  
The superior stability of Pipeline A stems from its parametric cross-spectrum approach, which explicitly models foreground spectra and leverages multi-frequency cross-correlations. Pipelines B and C, while effective for simple foregrounds, struggle with spatially varying SEDs due to ILC’s isotropic weighting (B) and fixed spectral indices (C). Residual biases in complex cases highlight the limitations of assuming uniform foreground properties. Delensing significantly reduces sample variance but requires precise template noise modeling. The trade-off between bias mitigation and uncertainty inflation underscores the need for adaptable residual marginalization strategies.  

# Implication  
The results emphasize the necessity of cross-validating pipelines to ensure reliable \(r\) measurements in CMB-S4. Pipeline A’s robustness advocates for its adoption as a baseline, while Pipelines B and C require enhancements in handling SED variability. Future work must address anisotropic noise, systematics, and Chilean site challenges, leveraging lessons from South Pole simulations. Achieving \(\sigma(r) \sim 10^{-4}\) demands hybrid methods combining parametric and non-parametric techniques, rigorous delensing, and multi-frequency coverage to mitigate foreground residuals. This study establishes a framework for optimizing component-separation strategies in next-generation CMB experiments.
