# Background  
Time delay interferometry (TDI) is crucial for space-based gravitational wave detectors like LISA, TAIJI, and TianQian to suppress laser noise. Second-generation TDI configurations, such as Michelson, address dynamic spacecraft motions but face limitations in noise suppression and data analysis. Previous work introduced the hybrid Relay configuration, which minimizes null frequencies but requires a long delay of \(7L\).  

# Motivation  
The hybrid Relay configuration’s long delay of \(7L\) poses practical challenges. This paper proposes PD4L, a novel TDI configuration with a reduced delay of \(3L\), offering advantages such as minimized null frequencies, reduced frequency aliasing, shorter signal tails, and improved parameter estimation accuracy for high-frequency gravitational waves. PD4L’s stable noise spectra and enhanced performance make it a promising candidate for future missions.  

# Methodology  
The PD4L configuration combines first-generation TDI configurations Beacon and Monitor, reducing the time span to \(4L\). Its observables, including the null stream, exhibit minimal null frequencies at \(m/L\) (\(m=1,2,3,...\)). Orthogonal transformations are applied when the real part of the cross spectral density (CSD) dominates, yielding science channels \(A\) and \(E\) for gravitational wave detection and \(T\) as a null stream. Additional null streams like \(C_{3}^{12}\) (time span \(2L\)) characterize instrumental noise. Noise spectra analyses include acceleration and optical metrology system (OMS) noise budgets:  
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sqrt{\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{acc}}}=3 \frac{\mathrm{fm} / \mathrm{s}^{2}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{~Hz}}} \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{0.4 \mathrm{mHz}}{f}\right)^{2}} \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{f}{8 \mathrm{mHz}}\right)^{4}} \\
& \sqrt{\mathrm{~S}_{\mathrm{oms}}}=15 \frac{\mathrm{pm}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{~Hz}}} \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{2 \mathrm{mHz}}{f}\right)^{4}}
\end{aligned}
\]  
Parameter inference uses Bayesian methods on simulated data from a merging massive black hole binary (MBBH) with redshifted chirp mass \(\mathcal{M}_c\), mass ratio \(q\), and time shift \(\Delta t_c\). Laser and clock noise suppression is evaluated, assuming laser stability of \(30 \mathrm{~Hz} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}\), clock noise modeled as \(4 \times 10^{-27} / f\), and ranging errors with a bias of \(3 \mathrm{~ns}\). Software tools include NumPy, SciPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and GetDist.  

# Results  
PD4L’s null stream \(\mathrm{T}_{\text{PD4L}}\) and \(C_{3}^{12}\) exhibit the fewest null frequencies, ensuring stable noise spectra. PD4L’s shorter time span reduces noise power spectral densities (PSDs) at low frequencies but increases sensitivity to arm length changes. The sky-averaged gravitational wave response \(\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{TDI}}(f)\) shows PD4L suppresses signals at \(u<0.1\) but matches Michelson and hybrid Relay in sensitivity due to lower noise PSD. For a MBBH signal (\(m_{1}=3 \times 10^{4} M_{\odot}\), \(m_{2}=1 \times 10^{4} M_{\odot}\), \(z=0.2\)), PD4L reduces margin effects, frequency aliasing, and tail effects, yielding smoother waveforms. Parameter inference places true values within \(2\sigma\) for PD4L, with Gaussian-like marginalized distributions. Noise characterization captures acceleration noise parameters within \(2\sigma\) for 120–180-day durations but struggles with OMS noise for longer spans.  

# Interpretation  
PD4L’s minimized null frequencies enhance phase coherence and high-frequency signal processing. Its shorter span mitigates waveform distortions and aliasing, favoring frequency-domain modeling. The null stream \(\mathrm{T}_{\text{PD4L}}\) is the most stable, outperforming \(C_{3}^{12}\) in amplitude and robustness. While PD4L suppresses gravitational waves and noise more strongly at low frequencies, its high-frequency performance offsets these limitations.  

# Implication  
PD4L’s reduced time span and stable null streams make it a viable alternative for future space-based detectors, particularly for high-frequency gravitational wave analysis. Its advantages in mitigating tail effects and aliasing simplify signal modeling, though trade-offs exist in low-frequency suppression and noise spectrum stability. Future work will explore correlations between PD4L and other configurations to optimize noise characterization and gravitational wave detection.
