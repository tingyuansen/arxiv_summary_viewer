# Background  
Galaxies quench when the central black hole's energy output exceeds 100 times the baryonic gravitational binding energy. The central kiloparsec stellar surface density \(\Sigma_{1}\) acts as a morphological indicator, with galaxies reddening as \(\Sigma_{1}\) increases until they cross the quenching boundary \(\Sigma_{1} \propto M_{\star}^{0.66}\). Mergers drive supermassive black hole growth and morphological evolution, leading to high-mass passive galaxies, while lower-mass passives are mainly satellites quenched by environmental effects. The GalICS 2.2 semi-analytic model validated this scenario, reproducing observed galaxy mass functions and morphological properties. This work extends the analysis to include disc and bulge radii, closing the loop by showing the model reproduces Chen et al.’s \(\Sigma_{1}-M_{\star}\) boundary and exploring the astrophysical origin of the \(M_{\bullet}-\Sigma_{1}\) correlation.

# Motivation  
The study aims to explain the empirical quenching boundary \(\Sigma_{1} \propto M_{\star}^{0.66}\), which links black hole mass \(M_{\bullet}\) to halo virial mass \(M_{\text{vir}}\) and velocity \(v_{\text{vir}}\). It seeks to establish \(\Sigma_{1}\) as a morphological indicator tied to bulge formation and black hole growth, distinguishing star-forming spirals (low \(\Sigma_{1}\)) from passive ellipticals (high \(\Sigma_{1}\)). The work also addresses the roles of mergers in driving quenching and environmental effects in satellite galaxy evolution.

# Methodology  
The GalICS 2.2 semi-analytic model incorporates quenching via black hole feedback (Model B) and morphological transformations using a merger model (Model 2) that allows continuous transitions between major and minor mergers. Energy conservation and the virial theorem are applied to determine bulge properties during mergers, with energy contributions from merging galaxies' bulges and discs. Stellar and dark matter interactions are analyzed using GalMer simulations, revealing energy transfer efficiencies. Dissipationless mergers assume \(2 T_{*} /|U_{*}|=1\), introducing ~20% errors deemed negligible. Star formation timescales distinguish quiescent discs (1 Gyr) from bursty cusp/bar regions (0.24 Gyr), with SFR following \(\mathrm{SFR}=\epsilon_{\mathrm{sf}} M_{\mathrm{gas}} / t_{\mathrm{dyn}}\) and \(\epsilon_{\text{sf}} \sim 1 / 25\). Tidal stripping is modeled via tidal radius \(r_{\mathrm{t}}\), with corrections for NFW profiles improving satellite mass estimates. The model uses redshift-dependent sSFR thresholds from CANDELS to classify star-forming and passive galaxies.

# Results  
GalICS 2.3 reproduces galaxy mass functions at \(0.5<z<2.5\), aligning with CANDELS and SDSS data. Star-forming galaxies lie within \(\pm 0.45\) dex of the main sequence, while passive galaxies show an upturn at low \(M_{\star}\) due to BH quenching (high-mass centrals) and environmental strangulation (low-mass satellites). Quenched galaxies with residual star formation exhibit lower \(\Sigma_{1}\) than passive galaxies, with \(\Sigma_{1}\) increasing as star formation fades. At \(z=0.05\), quenched galaxies match SDSS/ZENS \(\Sigma_{1}-M_{\star}\) relations, while star-forming galaxies follow steeper trends. The model predicts unobserved \(M_{\star} \sim 10^{12} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\) star-forming galaxies, possibly due to orphan subhaloes. Dissipationless mergers better reproduce mass-size relations across \(0<z<2.5\), though dissipative models improve agreement at \(z>1.5\).

# Interpretation  
The \(\Sigma_{1}-M_{\star}\) quenching boundary emerges naturally from the link between black hole growth and halo virial properties. Mergers drive morphological evolution, increasing \(\Sigma_{1}\) until galaxies cross the quenching threshold. A critical bulge-to-total ratio \(B/T \sim 0.3-0.5\) separates star-forming and passive populations. Post-quenching mergers further elevate \(B/T\), explaining color stratification in passive galaxies. Quenched star-forming galaxies (\(M_{\star}=10^{10.6 \pm 0.3} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\)) retain residual star formation from gas-rich mergers reactivating star formation. The model underestimates passive galaxies at \(M_{\star} \sim 10^{10} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\), suggesting unresolved environmental effects.

# Implication  
The study establishes a unified framework where BH feedback quenches high-mass centrals, while environmental effects dominate for low-mass satellites. Morphological indicators like \(\Sigma_{1}\) and \(B/T\) provide observable signatures of quenching pathways. The robustness of GalICS 2.3’s predictions across redshifts validates semi-analytic approaches for linking black hole physics to galaxy evolution. Systematic discrepancies at low \(z\) highlight uncertainties in stellar population models and light profile fitting. The findings underscore the importance of mergers in shaping galaxy demographics and the need for improved treatments of gas dissipation and environmental quenching in models.
