# Background  
This study investigates a secluded, self-interacting dark sector where dark matter (DM) interactions address small-scale structure issues. The dark sector features a spontaneously broken \(U(1)^{\prime}\) gauge symmetry mediated by a dark Higgs mechanism, generating nearly massless dark radiation (DR) to avoid over-closure. The model includes DM (\(\chi\)), DR (\(\psi\)), and a dark photon (\(A^{\prime}\)), with thermal evolution governed by interactions and phase transitions. Cosmological constraints from the effective number of neutrinos (\(N_{\text{eff}}\)) and Lyman-α observations strongly limit the parameter space.  

# Motivation  
The research aims to determine whether gravitational waves (GWs) from a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in this dark sector could be detected by future observatories like SKA or LISA. The secluded nature of the dark sector (minimal interaction with the visible sector) and self-interacting DM properties are explored to resolve discrepancies in small-scale structure formation while adhering to cosmological bounds.  

# Methodology  
The model employs a \(U(1)^{\prime}\)-gauged dark sector with a Lagrangian \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{Dark}}\) containing DM (\(\chi\)), dark Higgs (\(S\)), and DR (\(\psi\)). Symmetry breaking via \(S\) generates masses for \(\psi\), \(S\), and \(A^{\prime}\). The scalar potential \(V(S, \psi)\) ensures \(m_{\psi}^2 \ll (0.1 \text{eV})^2\), maintaining DR status. Key parameters include \(m_{\chi}\), \(m_{A^{\prime}}\), \(m_{s}\), and \(g^{\prime}\), constrained by small-scale structure data and FOPT dynamics. The dark sector thermalizes at high temperatures, with DM freeze-out via \(\chi \bar{\chi} \rightarrow A^{\prime} A^{\prime}\). A FOPT at the MeV scale produces stochastic GWs, with bubble collisions, sound waves, and turbulence contributing to the GW spectrum \(h^{2} \Omega_{\mathrm{GW}}(f)\). Parameter scans over \(\{m_{\chi}, m_{A^{\prime}}, \alpha^{\prime}, m_{s}, \xi_{\text{reh}}\}\) evaluate viability under \(N_{\text{eff}}\), Lyman-α, and DM self-interaction constraints.  

# Results  
Parameter space scans reveal stringent limits from \(\Delta N_{\text{eff}} = \frac{8}{7} \left(\frac{4}{11}\right)^{-4/3} \xi_{\infty}^4\) (constrained to \(\Delta N_{\text{eff}} < 0.29\) by Planck + BAO) and dark acoustic oscillations (DAO) from DM-DR scattering (\(a_{\text{dark}} < 30 \xi_{\infty}^{-4} \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\)). DM self-interaction cross-sections \(\bar{\sigma} / m_{\chi}\) vary with velocity, requiring \(\mathcal{O}(10)-\mathcal{O}(100) \text{ cm}^2/\text{g}\) for dwarf galaxies but \(<1 \text{ cm}^2/\text{g}\) for clusters. GW amplitudes \(h^{2} \Omega_{\mathrm{GW}}^{\text{peak}}\) reach up to \(10^{-7}\) in unconstrained regions but are suppressed by four orders of magnitude due to \(\Delta N_{\text{eff}}\) and DAO bounds.  

# Interpretation  
The secluded self-interacting dark sector successfully addresses small-scale structure anomalies but faces severe limitations from cosmological observables. GW signals from FOPTs are predominantly undetectable by SKA or LISA under current constraints, as phase transition dynamics and dark sector reheating (\(\xi_{\infty}\) evolution) heavily suppress GW amplitudes.  

# Implication  
The results underscore the challenge of probing secluded dark sectors via GWs or traditional methods. Even with strong DM self-interactions resolving astrophysical discrepancies, cosmological bounds on DR and DM-DR scattering render GW detection unlikely. Future work must address theoretical uncertainties in GW calculations and explore alternative detection strategies for such scenarios.
