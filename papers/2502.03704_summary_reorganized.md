# Background  
The origin of \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) on Europa, detected in its exosphere and surface chaos regions, remains uncertain, with debates centering on whether it forms via radiolysis or originates from subsurface ocean upwelling. \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) is prevalent across icy bodies like Europa, Ganymede, and Enceladus, but its endogenic versus exogenic origin is unresolved. Recent studies suggest Europa’s \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) is endogenic, linked to young chaos terrains. Radiolysis of complex organic molecules (COMs), including hydrocarbons, alcohols, and carboxylic acids—detected throughout the Solar System—may generate \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) and influence surface and exospheric compositions.  

# Motivation  
This study investigates the radiolysis pathway by examining how functional groups in COMs affect electron-induced sputtering behavior, particularly \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) production, at temperatures (80–120 K) relevant to icy bodies like Europa, Titan, and Enceladus. The goal is to determine whether carboxylic acid groups enhance volatile species ejection, providing insights into the potential sources of \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) detected on Europa.  

# Methodology  
Electron sputtering experiments were conducted at JPL’s Ice Spectroscopy Laboratory using a vacuum chamber (<10\(^{-8}\) mbar) equipped with an electron gun and quadrupole mass spectrometer. Ice samples (\(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\):hexanoic acid, \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\):hexanol, \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\):hexane) were prepared via vapor or spray deposition onto a copper substrate cooled by a closed-cycle helium cryostat (80 K, 100 K, 120 K). A 2 keV electron beam (5 µA current, 120-minute irradiation) delivered an energy flux of \(1.1 \times 10^{13}\) keV cm\(^{-2}\) s\(^{-1}\), simulating ~360 hours of radiation exposure on Europa. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments identified released species.  

# Results  
Hexanoic acid ice produced 78% more \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) than pure water ice at 100 K, while hexanol ice yielded 24% more. Acid-functionalized molecules generated over 10x more \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) than non- or alcohol-functionalized ones, with yields peaking at 100–120 K. Hydrocarbon fragments (\(\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{z}=15\), likely \(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\)) showed higher intensities in acid-functionalized ices. Pentane (\(\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{z}=72\)) sputtering was ~100x higher in \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\):hexanoic acid than in \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\):hexanol at 120 K. TPD revealed that 36% of \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) was sputtered at 80 K for hexanoic acid, compared to 97% at 120 K. Hexanoic acid ice released pentane and \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) via \(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{COOH}\) cleavage, while hexanol ice produced less-volatile hexane via \(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{OH}\) cleavage.  

# Interpretation  
Carboxylic acid groups facilitate \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) production through simple bond cleavage, whereas alcohols require oxidation, which may lose volatile intermediates. Temperature-dependent volatility determines whether species are ejected into the exosphere or retained on the surface. Acids generate shorter carbon chains and more \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\), leaving hydrocarbon residues. Fatty acids, if present, may sputter \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) and hydrocarbons, but their detectability as biosignatures diminishes once the carboxylic group is lost.  

# Implication  
The functional group composition and surface temperature of icy bodies critically influence their exosphere and surface chemistry. Carboxylic acids enhance \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) and hydrocarbon ejection, potentially explaining Europa’s \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\)-rich chaos regions. These findings underscore the role of radiation-induced bond cleavage and volatility in shaping the observable chemistry of icy moons, with implications for future missions targeting biosignature detection.
