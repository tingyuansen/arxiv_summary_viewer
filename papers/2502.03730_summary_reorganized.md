# Background  
The evolution of galaxies is influenced by active galactic nuclei (AGN) through radiative and mechanical feedback mechanisms, which regulate star formation. While these feedback modes are often considered distinct, recent studies suggest overlap, with many AGN exhibiting mixed characteristics. The alignment of radio jets with host galaxies and the cosmic web remains a critical area of study, as cosmic filaments shape large-scale matter flows and galaxy evolution.  

# Motivation  
This study investigates the orientations of radio jets and their optical counterparts relative to cosmic filaments to understand how cosmic environments influence AGN activity and galaxy structure. By leveraging multiwavelength data, the work aims to clarify the interplay between filamentary accretion, galaxy mergers, and jet alignment, addressing gaps in understanding the environmental dependence of AGN feedback and intrinsic galaxy alignments.  

# Methodology  
The analysis combines data from LOFARâ€™s LoTSS DR2 (identifying ~4 million radio sources), DESI Legacy Surveys (providing optical properties and ellipticities), and SDSS DR12 (utilizing the DisPerSE algorithm to identify cosmic filaments at \(z \approx 0-0.8\)). Two samples are analyzed: the General Massive Radio Galaxy (GMRG) sample (84,409 sources, \(M_* > 10^{11} M_\odot\)) for optical-filament alignments, and the Extended Jet (EJ) subset (7,297 sources with \(L_{144} > 10^{24} \, \mathrm{W \, Hz^{-1}}\), \(LAS > 20^{\prime\prime}\)) for jet-host galaxy alignments. Filament proximity is measured using 3D Cartesian coordinates, with orientation vectors converted to spherical coordinates for alignment comparisons. The parallel transport method ensures accurate angular comparisons, and spectroscopic redshifts (\(z < 0.6\)) prioritize precise 3D localization.  

# Results  
Galaxies within \(\lesssim 11 \, \mathrm{Mpc}\) of cosmic filaments align their optical major axes parallel to filaments, with the strongest alignment near filament spines (\(\lesssim 6 \, \mathrm{Mpc}\)). Radio jets generally orient perpendicularly to host galaxy major axes, peaking at \(90^\circ\), particularly for galaxies with higher optical ellipticity (\(\left|\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}\right| > 0.05\)). However, within \(\lesssim 8 \, \mathrm{Mpc}\) of filaments, jet orientations become randomized, showing reduced skewness (\(p = 0.036\) via KS tests) and a higher fraction of misaligned jets (\(60.2\%\) vs. \(56.2\%\) at larger distances).  

# Interpretation  
The alignment of galaxy major axes with filaments suggests growth via mergers channeled along filaments, consistent with simulations of directional accretion in massive halos. The perpendicular jet-galaxy alignment reflects secular accretion processes, while randomization near filaments implies chaotic gas accretion driven by galaxy interactions in dense environments. Projection effects confirm the physical origin of these trends, linking cosmic web dynamics to AGN activity.  

# Implication  
Intrinsic galaxy alignments with filaments (\(M_* > 10^{11} M_\odot\)) necessitate corrections in weak lensing surveys to avoid cosmological biases. Anisotropic AGN jet feedback influences circumgalactic medium (CGM) properties, but environmental dependence near filaments reduces predictability. These findings underscore the role of cosmic filaments in shaping galaxy evolution, AGN feedback modes, and CGM anisotropy, informing models of large-scale structure and feedback efficacy.
