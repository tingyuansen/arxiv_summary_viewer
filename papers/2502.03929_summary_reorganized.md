# Background  
Spin-precession and orbital eccentricity in gravitational-wave (GW) signals are crucial for understanding compact binary formation and evolution. At Newtonian order, an eccentric binary orbit is described by Keplerian parametrization: \(r(u) = a(1 - e \cos u)\), \(\phi_N = v(u) = 2 \arctan\left[\left(\frac{1+e}{1-e}\right)^{1/2} \tan \frac{u}{2}\right]\), and \(\ell = u - e \sin u\), where \(a\), \(e\), and \(u\) are the semi-major axis, eccentricity, and eccentric anomaly, respectively. Post-Newtonian (PN) effects introduce periastron advance \(k\), modifying the orbital phase \(\phi = (1+k)v \approx (1+k)\ell + (v - \ell)\). The GW polarizations \(h_{+, \times}\) are decomposed using spin-weighted spherical harmonics, with spin-induced precession complicating the GW modes. Transforming to a co-precessing frame simplifies the analysis, where inertial frame polarizations are reconstructed using Wigner \(D\)-matrices and Euler angles.  

# Motivation  
Accurate modeling of spin-precession and eccentricity remains challenging. PyEFPE addresses this by improving numerical stability, introducing analytical expressions for Fourier mode amplitudes, and incorporating recent PN corrections. It aims to provide a flexible framework for future enhancements while achieving computational efficiency for GW data analysis.  

# Methodology  
The waveform model employs Newtonian Fourier mode amplitudes for dominant \(l=2, m=\{0, \pm 2\}\) modes, derived using Bessel functions to simplify nested sums. Fourier mode selection optimizes efficiency by including minimal modes to meet tolerance \(\epsilon_N\). Spin precession in eccentric orbits is modeled via multiple scale analysis (MSA), separating radiation reaction (RR) and spin precession timescales. The precession equations, including leading PN spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions, are solved analytically using Jacobi elliptic functions. Radiation reaction effects are incorporated through PN parameter \(y\) and eccentricity \(e\) evolution equations:  
\[
\mathcal{D} y = \nu y^{9}\left(a_{0}+\sum_{n=2}^{6} a_{n} y^{n}\right), \quad \mathcal{D} e^{2} = -\nu y^{8}\left(b_{0}+\sum_{n=2}^{6} b_{n} y^{n}\right).
\]  
Initial conditions are set using astrophysical parameters (masses, spins, eccentricity) and converted to model variables. The Fourier transform for frequency-domain waveforms uses the Shifted Uniform Asymptotics (SUA) method, correcting amplitude time-dependence. Amplitude interpolation reduces computational cost via Chebyshev polynomials and cubic splines.  

# Results  
PyEFPE achieves a computational speedup of \(\sim \mathcal{O}(20)\) compared to time-domain models. Validation against SpinTaylorT4 and TaylorF2 shows mismatches \(\lesssim 10^{-3}\) for aligned-spin cases, increasing to \(\lesssim 10^{-1}\) for precessing systems with higher PN corrections. Comparisons with TaylorF2Ecc reveal growing mismatches with eccentricity, highlighting PyEFPE’s advantage for large \(e\). Parameter estimation tests recover injected values (e.g., \(e_0=0.2\), \(\chi_p\)) with posteriors consistent with true parameters. Amplitude interpolation reduces waveform evaluation time to \(\sim 0.1\)s for \(T \leq 32\)s, enabling feasible Bayesian inference.  

# Interpretation  
The model’s accuracy is sufficient for current detectors, though higher PN terms are needed for future observatories like LISA. Eccentricity and precession effects decouple in low-mass systems, enabling independent measurement via orbital phase \(\lambda\) and periastron advance \(\delta \lambda\). Mismatches with IMRPhenomXP emphasize the need for higher-order spin corrections. Computational efficiency is driven by analytical precession solutions and amplitude interpolation, critical for long-duration signals.  

# Implication  
PyEFPE provides a publicly available tool (https://github.com/gmorras/pyEFPE) for Bayesian inference and real-data analysis. Future work will incorporate higher-order modes, tidal effects, and merger-ringdown phases. The model advances GW astronomy by enabling detailed studies of binary formation channels and spin-eccentricity correlations.
