# Background  
Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy enables probing neutron star (NS) core matter via tidal deformability \(\Lambda\), linked to the equation of state (EOS) through the \(\mathrm{p}-\epsilon\) and \(\Lambda-\mathrm{m}\) relations. Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers imprint masses and tidal deformabilities in GW signals, extractable via Bayesian inference from waveform models calibrated to numerical relativity. Current detectors like LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA focus on compact binary coalescences, while next-generation detectors (Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer) aim to enhance sensitivity for refined NS property studies. Nonparametric inference methods dissociate macroscopic mass-radius relations from microscopic EOS details, as demonstrated in GW170817. Joint analyses of NICER and LIGO/Virgo measurements further constrain the dense matter EOS, with multi-messenger observations (e.g., X-ray data from millisecond pulsars) providing additional insights into neutron-rich matter and QCD phase transitions.  

# Motivation  
Noise and priors in GW data analysis introduce biases, necessitating multi-event analyses for robust EOS determination. Existing approaches face challenges in minimizing uncertainties and maximizing selection efficiency. The need for a framework that leverages GW data to dissociate macroscopic \(\mathrm{m}-\Lambda\) information from microscopic \(\mathrm{p}-\epsilon\) details motivates the development of BEOMS. This Bayesian model selection framework addresses degeneracies in parameter spaces, computational inefficiencies, and biases arising from phenomenological EOS parameterizations.  

# Methodology  
The BEOMS framework evaluates EOS models in \(\mathrm{m}-\Lambda\) space using EOS-agnostic parameter estimation (PE) results from BNS mergers. Evidence calculations start from the marginalized 4D posterior \(\mathrm{p}(\mathrm{m}_1, \Lambda_1, \mathrm{m}_2, \Lambda_2)\), transformed and marginalized to 2D/3D spaces for efficiency. Bayesian evidence \(\mathrm{Z}_{\mathrm{k}}\) for EOS hypotheses integrates over constrained parameter spaces, excluding samples beyond EOS maximum mass. Transformations to \(\tilde{\Lambda}\)-\(\delta\tilde{\Lambda}\) space fix chirp mass \(\mathcal{M}\), while \(\mathrm{m}_1\)-\(\Lambda_1\) and \(\mathrm{m}_2\)-\(\Lambda_2\) subspaces assume statistical independence. PE uses relative binning in Bilby with simulated BNS signals (IMRPhenomPv2_NRTidalv2), component masses sampled from double Gaussian distributions (\(\mu=1.35\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\), \(\sigma=0.08\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\); \(\mu=1.8\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\), \(\sigma=0.3\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\)), and uniform priors for spins, distances, and tidal deformabilities.  

# Results  
PE runs for 100 BNS events per EOS (APR4, DD2, SLy) show detector networks (O5, A\#, ECC) improving sensitivity: O5 detects 70/100 events, A\# detects 88, and ECC detects all 100. ECC achieves \(\sim\)100-fold higher SNR than O5, enhancing chirp mass precision by 100-fold. Evidence distributions for injected EOS models (DD2, APR4, SLy) show higher mean evidence in zero-noise scenarios, though realistic noise and low SNR skew results. Cumulative evidence from multiple events asymptotically favors the injected EOS, with ECC requiring the fewest events for distinguishability. Subspace evidence (\(Z_{m-\Lambda}\)) outperforms 4D calculations, reducing Occam’s penalty. For LIGO events (GW170817, GW190425), current sensitivity necessitates \(\sim\)20 events for reliable differentiation.  

# Interpretation  
BEOMS validates its robustness through injection studies, demonstrating that evidence increases with \(\mathrm{L}_{2}\) distance between EOSs. The framework’s efficiency depends on BNS mass distributions, with fiducial NS mass distributions potentially skewing results for overlapping EOSs. Ignoring pairwise correlations between \(\mathrm{p}(\mathrm{m}_1, \Lambda_1)\) and \(\mathrm{p}(\mathrm{m}_2, \Lambda_2)\) improves model selection by mitigating Occam’s penalty. The cumulative Bayes factor matrix reveals that diagonal terms dominate as events accumulate, ensuring correct EOS identification.  

# Implication  
BEOMS enhances EOS model selection for future GW detectors, particularly next-gen networks like ECC, which offer \(\mathcal{O}(10)-\mathcal{O}(100)\) sensitivity improvements. Subspace evidence calculations are recommended to balance efficiency and accuracy, though population-informed adjustments are needed for overlapping EOSs. Future work will address eccentricity, spin effects, waveform uncertainties, and multi-messenger integration. Advances in Bayesian tools (e.g., Bilby) and relative binning will refine NS EOS constraints, bridging GW and electromagnetic observations to advance dense matter physics.
