# Background  
Small-scale (\(\lesssim 1^{\prime \prime}\)) magnetic reconnection events, such as Ellerman bombs (EBs) and UV bursts (UVBs), are crucial for understanding solar atmospheric dynamics. These transient phenomena, often linked to opposite magnetic polarities, exhibit complex spectral signatures and outflows. Observations suggest diverse configurations, from U-type separatrices to fan-spine topologies, connecting small-scale events to larger flares. Key questions focus on magnetic topology, reconnection mechanisms (e.g., tearing mode instability, turbulent reconnection), and the role of plasmoid-like structures.  

# Motivation  
This study leverages DKIST data to analyze a small-scale brightening, employing non-LTE inversions and NLFFF extrapolations to explore its atmospheric and magnetic properties. The goal is to investigate the interplay between magnetic topology, energy release, and plasma dynamics, with potential nonthermal particle contributions to multi-wavelength emissions.  

# Methodology  
DKIST observations of AR NOAA 13465 utilized the Visible Broadband Imager (VBI) and Visible Spectro-Polarimeter (ViSP). VBI captured high-resolution images in G-band, \(\mathrm{H} \beta\), and Ca II K filters. ViSP performed spectropolarimetric raster scans in Fe I 6301/6302 Å, Na I D 5896 Å, and Ca II 8542 Å. Data were processed with speckle algorithms, polarization calibration, and NLTE inversions using the STiC code. Magnetic field extrapolations employed a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) to enforce force-free equations, combining DKIST/ViSP and SDO/HMI data.  

# Results  
The event showed Ellerman bomb-like morphology in \(\mathrm{H} \beta\), annular Ca II K emission (\(\mathrm{FWHM} \sim 0.11^{\prime \prime}\)), and bidirectional flows (downflows \(\sim -18 \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\), upflows \(\sim 28 \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\)). NLTE inversions revealed temperature enhancements (\(\sim 100-2,000 \, \mathrm{K}\)) in the photosphere (\(\log \tau \sim -2\)) and microturbulence peaks (\(\sim 14 \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\)). Magnetic flux cancellation occurred at \(d\Phi/dt \sim 3 \times 10^{15} \, \mathrm{Mx} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\), with energy estimates of \(\sim 10^{27} \, \mathrm{erg}\). NLFFF extrapolations uncovered a low-lying fan-spine configuration (\(\sim 700 \, \mathrm{km}\) height) with a null point and quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs; \(Q \sim 10^{2}-10^{4}\)).  

# Interpretation  
The annular Ca II K structure aligns with a magnetic dome formed during flux cancellation, where reconnection along QSLs drives bidirectional flows and heating. The fan-spine topology explains jet-like structures and plasmoid-like blobs observed in VBI. Temperature enhancements and radiative losses (\(\sim 70 \, \mathrm{kW} \, \mathrm{m}^{-2}\)) suggest nonthermal particle heating, though thermal models fit line profiles. The event’s invisibility in sodium lines and strong \(\mathrm{H} \beta\) emissions may reflect energy deposition differences across atmospheric layers.  

# Implication  
The study highlights the role of low-altitude reconnection in shaping multi-wavelength emissions and plasma dynamics. High-cadence, multi-instrument observations are essential to disentangle thermal and nonthermal processes. DKIST’s capabilities advance understanding of magnetic topology-stress relationships, with implications for energy transfer mechanisms in small-scale solar events.
