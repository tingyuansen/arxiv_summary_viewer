# Background  
Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs), with infrared luminosities of \(10^{11}\) to \(10^{12}\) solar luminosities, are pivotal in understanding galaxy evolution. They derive energy from star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN), with mergers often driving these processes. LIRGs are crucial for studying the relationship between galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and explaining high-redshift quasars.  

# Motivation  
The study aims to investigate the interplay between gas content, star formation, and galaxy evolution in LIRGs. These galaxies provide insights into gas dynamics, baryonic mass fractions, and the processes governing gas depletion and accretion, which are essential for understanding the evolutionary pathways of galaxies and their connection to SMBHs.  

# Methodology  
The study analyzed 82 LIRGs using data from SDSS DR17, NED, and HyperLEDA, focusing on morphological types, B-band diameters, H I magnitudes, radial velocities, color filters (g, r-bands), extinction values, inclination angles, line widths, and redshifts. Key parameters, including stellar mass \(M_{\text{star}}\), star formation rate (SFR), dust mass, baryonic mass, and dynamical mass, were calculated. Photometric distance \(D\) was derived using the post-Hubble relation with cosmological constants (\(\Omega_m = 0.308\), \(\Omega_\Lambda = 0.692\), \(q_0 = -0.55\)). Neutral hydrogen mass \(M_{\text{HI}}\) was calculated from 21-cm line flux, corrected for inclination. Dust mass \(M_{\text{dust}}\) was estimated using FIR fluxes at 60 and 100 \(\mu m\), with dust temperature \(T_{\text{dust}}\) derived from their ratio. Dynamical mass \(M_{\text{dyn}}\) was computed from circular velocity \(V_c\), Hi linewidth \(W_{50,\text{HI}}\), and inclination \(i\). Stellar mass \(M^*\) was determined from optical colors and mass-to-light ratios \(\Upsilon^*\), while total gas mass \(M_{\text{gas}}\) included contributions from HI, H\(_2\), and helium. Molecular gas mass \(M_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}\) was approximated as \(0.07 M^{*}\), linked to stellar mass via \(\log M_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}\left(M_{\odot}\right)=\log M^{*, V}-1.16\). Gas depletion time \(\tau_{\text{dep}}\) was calculated as \(M_{\text{gas}} / \mathrm{SFR}\). NGC 7679 was observed using ALMA as a representative LIRG.  

# Results  
The molecular-to-atomic hydrogen gas ratio \(M_{\mathrm{H}_{2}} / M_{\mathrm{H}_{1}}\) correlates with morphological types, gas mass fractions, and galaxy characteristics like color and luminosity. Late-type galaxies (Sd-Sm-Irr) exhibit molecular gas masses five times less than atomic gas, while early-type galaxies (E-S0) show the opposite trend. Dust-to-stellar content ratios decrease as gas is consumed for star formation, while gas mass fraction \(\left(f_{\text{gas}}\right)\) increases with declining stellar mass (correlation coefficient -0.7). Galaxies with high \(f_{\text{gas}}\) either accrete gas rapidly or convert it into stars less efficiently. Gas depletion time \(\tau_{\text{dep}}\) decreases sharply with increasing stellar mass (regression -0.9), with massive galaxies (\(M^{*, V} \geq 10^{10} M_{\odot}\)) having \(\tau_{\text{dep}}\) shorter than the Hubble time. Dust mass (\(M_{\text{dust}} \approx 5.4 \times 10^{6} M_{\odot}\)) correlates with stellar mass and SFR (regression coefficients >0.5), while the dust-to-baryonic mass fraction \(f_{\text{dust,bar}}\) is low (0.00018). Metallicity inversely affects baryonic gas fraction, modeled as \(\phi=1-(y+Z)\), with intergalactic hydrogen fraction \(\eta = \phi^{-1}\) ranging from 1.36 to 1.5.  

# Interpretation  
The scatter in \(M_{\mathrm{H}_{2}} / M_{\mathrm{HI}}\) ratios is attributed to morphological classification challenges and environmental factors. The negative correlation between gas fraction and \((B-V)_{\text{corrected}}\) may result from low SFRs. The flattening of the \(M_{\text{dust}}-M^{*, V}\) relationship at high stellar masses indicates dust loss in massive LIRGs. The strong negative correlation between \(\tau_{\text{dep}}\) and stellar mass suggests massive galaxies are nearing gas depletion, while less massive galaxies retain significant gas reserves. The metallicity-dependent model \(\phi=1-(y+Z)\) highlights the role of stellar mass and gas dynamics in regulating gas evolution.  

# Implication  
These results challenge the notion that LIRGs continuously accrete new gas, indicating instead that massive galaxies actively deplete their existing gas supplies. The study underscores the interplay between gas content, star formation efficiency, and galaxy evolution, providing critical insights into the shutdown of star formation in massive LIRGs. The consistency of \(\eta\) with theoretical predictions supports models of baryonic gas evolution influenced by metallicity and stellar mass.
