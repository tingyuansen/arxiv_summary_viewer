# Background  
Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) consist of a stellar-mass black hole accreting matter from a companion star, forming an accretion disc where viscosity facilitates angular momentum transfer. Outbursts in BHXRBs, driven by disc instabilities, produce multi-wavelength radiation, predominantly in X-rays, with spectral and timing variations occurring over days to years. X-ray variability, observed down to millisecond timescales, includes broad-band noise and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), the latter potentially linked to relativistic disc precession. Hard lags, where high-energy photons lag low-energy ones, are observed at low Fourier frequencies, attributed to accretion rate fluctuations propagating from outer to inner disc regions. At high frequencies, soft lags occur, explained by reverberation from disc reflection. The zero-crossing point, where soft lags transition to hard lags, offers insights into inner accretion flow geometry but remains poorly understood. Recent studies in systems like MAXI J1820+070 reveal evolving hard and soft lags, with soft lags shortening in timescale during outbursts. Models like Reltrans and Wilkins et al. (2016) attempt to explain these lags, but observational evidence suggests an extended corona and multiple emission components.  

# Motivation  
This study aims to explore how disc viscosity and corona geometry influence X-ray lag evolution during BHXRB outbursts, addressing the unresolved nature of the zero-crossing point and the need for comprehensive simulations that incorporate both propagating fluctuations and reverberation effects. Future polarization observations from IXPE and eXTP are highlighted as critical tools for clarifying corona geometry, motivating the development of models that can be tested against these upcoming datasets.  

# Methodology  
The study employs Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations of a jet base corona, incorporating accretion rate fluctuations and reverberation delays. The corona is modeled as a hyperbolic surface parameterized by semi-major axis \(a=10 R_g\), semi-minor axis \(b=2 R_g\), and height boundaries \(h_t, h_b\). Radiative processes include disc thermal emission (Novikov-Thorne model), Comptonization in the corona, and disc reflection, producing spectra with power-law cutoffs, emission lines, and Compton humps. Photons are traced geometrically in a Newtonian framework, with variability introduced via propagating accretion rate fluctuations (Ingram & Done 2011; 2012 framework). Reflection is modeled using García et al. (2013) and Dauser et al. (2013), with the Xillver model interpolating parameters \(\Gamma\), \(\xi\), \(A_{\mathrm{Fe}}\), and \(i\). Shielding effects are approximated using a two-zone corona with transmittance values \(\kappa_{1}\) and \(\kappa_{2}\), and radius \(r_{\text{cover}}\). Simulations capture light curves for disc, Compton, and reflection components over 200 seconds with 1/1000-second resolution.  

# Results  
Simulations reproduce observed inter-band lag spectra, showing low-frequency hard lags and high-frequency soft lags. Key parameters include a black hole mass \(M=7 M_{\odot}\), accretion rate \(\dot{m}=0.01\), disc temperature \(T_i=0.15 \mathrm{keV}\), inner radius \(r_{\text{in}}=10 R_g\), and viscous factor \(\alpha=0.1\). The time-averaged spectrum exhibits a cutoff power-law (\(\Gamma \sim 2\)), thermal peak (\(\sim 0.1 \mathrm{keV}\)), and high-ionized reflection. As corona height decreases from \(35 R_g\) to \(16 R_g\) and maximum viscous frequency increases from 2 Hz to 30 Hz, soft lag amplitudes diminish, and zero-crossing points shift to higher frequencies, aligning with observed trends in MAXI J1820+070. Propagation lads dominate at low frequencies due to delays between outer and inner disc regions, while spatial lags prevail at high frequencies.  

# Interpretation  
The observed lag evolution arises from the interplay between corona geometry and disc viscosity. Low-frequency hard lags are driven by viscous propagation delays, while high-frequency soft lags result from reverberation effects and light travel times. A spherical corona model also reproduces lag patterns, but polarization studies (e.g., IXPE) favor a vertically extended geometry. Energy-dependent lag spectra below 1 keV match observations, but deviations above 1 keV suggest unmodeled coronal fluctuation propagation. Simplified assumptions, such as neglecting heating effects, may limit the model’s accuracy, necessitating future refinements.  

# Implication  
The study underscores the importance of X-ray polarization observations from IXPE and eXTP in distinguishing corona geometries. Simulations suggest that evolving lag patterns during BHXRB outbursts can constrain corona size and disc viscosity, providing a framework for interpreting future timing and spectral data. Incorporating coronal fluctuation propagation and refining shielding approximations will enhance model fidelity, aiding in the understanding of accretion physics and relativistic processes near black holes.
