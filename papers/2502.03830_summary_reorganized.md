# Background  
Pulsars, highly magnetized neutron stars, exhibit stable radio emissions but also intriguing variability like nulls, mode changes, bright pulses, and microstructures. Nulls, periods of diminished or absent emission, occur on timescales from single rotations to months, with null fractions ranging from 0% to 95%. These phenomena are linked to magnetospheric instabilities or plasma supply disruptions. Bright pulses, or giant pulses, represent intense flares from localized magnetospheric activity, while microstructures offer insights into pulsar emission dynamics. The FAST telescope has advanced pulsar studies, discovering over 180 new pulsars, including long-period ones like PSR J1900-0134, with notable magnetic fields and spin-down energy loss rates.  

# Motivation  
This paper explores the emission phenomena (nulls, dwarf pulses, bright pulses, and microstructures) in three long-period pulsars observed with FAST, aiming to understand their magnetospheric dynamics and implications for pulsar physics.  

# Methodology  
FAST, with a 300-meter aperture, observed long-period pulsars during the CRAFTS Survey using a 19-beam receiver (1.05â€“1.45 GHz) and ROACH2 processor. Data, with \(49.152 \mu \mathrm{s}\) time and 0.488 MHz frequency resolution, were processed offline using DSPSR and PSRCHIVE software. RFI was excised, and single-pulse sequences were averaged, baseline-subtracted, and organized into pulse stacks. Flux calibration employed the radiometer equation, yielding \(S_{\text{av}} \approx 3.5 \text{ mJy}\).  

# Results  
FAST observations of PSR J1945+1211, PSR J2323+1214, and PSR J1900-0134 reveal complex single-pulse behaviors, including burst pulses, bridge emission, quasi-periodic nulls, and intricate microstructures. Pulse energy distributions show bimodal patterns, with null fractions of \(52.46\% \pm 2.89\%\) (PSR J1945+1211), \(48.48\% \pm 2.51\%\) (PSR J2323+1214), and \(27.51\% \pm 1.37\%\) (PSR J1900-0134). PSR J2323+1214 exhibits asymmetrical nulling (\(61.34\% \pm 1.82\%\) in leading vs. \(50.27\% \pm 1.73\%\) in trailing components). Quasi-periodic null-burst transitions occur with periodicities of \(15.38 \pm 0.90\) periods (PSR J1945+1211) and \(22.22 \pm 2.4\) periods (PSR J2323+1214). Dwarf pulses (\(0.011\%\) of observations) in PSR J2323+1214 and bright pulses (\(>10\times\) average intensity) in all pulsars were detected. PSR J1900-0134 displayed 95 microstructure pulses with periodicities ranging from \(0.098\) to \(3.792\) ms. Burst pulses exhibited widths up to 498.9 ms (PSR J1945+1211) and fluences up to 282.500 Jy ms, highlighting emission variability.  

# Interpretation  
The high null fractions and quasi-periodic transitions suggest magnetospheric instabilities linked to plasma generation disruptions. Asymmetric nulling and component-dependent emission profiles imply variations in magnetic field structure or viewing geometry. Microstructures and bright pulses reflect localized magnetospheric activity, while dwarf pulses indicate fragile emission mechanisms near the death line. Long-period pulsars exhibit wider pulse widths and more complex substructures than ordinary pulsars, attributed to slower rotation and dynamic magnetospheres.  

# Implication  
These findings challenge traditional pulsar emission theories, particularly near the death line, where sustained radio emission persists despite low spin-down luminosities (\(<10^{31} \mathrm{erg/s}\)). Quasi-periodic nulls and microstructure periodicities suggest underlying magnetospheric carousel processes. The diversity of emission behaviors underscores the need for high-sensitivity observations to refine models of plasma dynamics and pulsar evolution.
