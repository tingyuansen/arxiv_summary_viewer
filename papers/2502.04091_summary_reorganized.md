# Background  
The \(\Lambda\)CDM model underpins cosmic structure formation, where larger galaxies emerge hierarchically through mergers and accretion of smaller systems. Dwarf galaxies, forming slowly in low-mass halos, are crucial for studying galaxy evolution due to their sensitivity to environmental effects. The morphology-density relation shows that galaxy morphology varies with local density, with elliptical fractions increasing in denser regions. Galaxy clusters like Fornax provide ideal settings to study environmental mechanisms such as ram-pressure stripping, tidal distortion, and harassment, which drive morphological transformations. Quantifying galaxy morphology has evolved from visual classifications to parametric and non-parametric methods like the CAS (Concentration, Asymmetry, Smoothness) system, which is effective for irregular galaxies. The Fornax cluster, the second most massive within 20 Mpc, offers a unique environment to study galaxy evolution due to its proximity and complex structure, with surveys like the Fornax Deep Survey (FDS) providing deep multi-wavelength data.  

# Motivation  
The Fornax cluster, with its dense core and strong tidal fields, serves as an ideal environment to study the impact of cluster dynamics on dwarf galaxy morphology. Using the Fornax Deep Survey (FDS), this work aims to analyze environmental effects on dwarf galaxies through asymmetry and smoothness parameters, leveraging deep imaging to explore mechanisms like ram pressure stripping and tidal interactions. The study seeks to understand how these processes drive morphological transformations, particularly in transitioning dwarfs toward quiescence, and to provide insights for future surveys like Euclid.  

# Methodology  
Morphologies of 556 dwarf galaxies in the Fornax cluster are quantified using asymmetry (\(A\)) and smoothness (\(S\)) parameters. Asymmetry measures rotational symmetry by rotating a galaxy by \(180^{\circ}\) and subtracting the rotated image from the original:  
\[
A=\frac{\sum\left(I_{0}-I_{\theta}\right)}{2 \sum\left|I_{0}\right|}-A_{b g r},
\]  
where \(I_{0}\) is the original image, \(I_{\theta}\) is the rotated image, and \(A_{b g r}\) is background asymmetry. Smoothness measures small-scale structure:  
\[
S=10 \times \sum_{x, y=1,1}^{N, N} \frac{\left(I_{x, y}-I_{x, y}^{\sigma}\right)-B_{x, y}}{I_{x, y}},
\]  
where \(I_{x, y}^{\sigma}\) is the smoothed image, and \(B_{x, y}\) is the smoothed background. Asymmetry profiles are analyzed in elliptical annuli across \(g\), \(r\), and \(i\) bands, with background subtraction performed by masking sources and fitting a sky model \(z=C_{1}(x-x_{0})+C_{2}(y-y_{0})+C_{0}\). Data from the FDS Dwarf Galaxy Catalogue (FDSDC), reaching a surface brightness limit of \(\bar{\mu}_{e, r'} = 26 \mathrm{mag} \operatorname{arcsec}^{-2}\), are used to ensure robust measurements.  

# Results  
Analysis of 556 dwarf galaxies reveals higher asymmetry in outer (\(R > 1 \mathrm{Mpc}\)) and very central (\(R \leq 0.12 \mathrm{Mpc}\)) regions, linked to ram pressure stripping and tidal effects, respectively. Asymmetry increases with fainter magnitudes (\(M_{r'}\)) and bluer colors, while smoothness decreases with stellar mass. Phase-space analysis shows elevated asymmetry near pericentre, indicating morphological disturbances during first pericentric passages. Low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies show no clear asymmetry correlation, suggesting galaxy size or other factors dominate. Simulations using \(r\)-band FDS data reveal detection bias for dwarfs within 10 kpc of NGC 1399, with minimal impact on overall results.  

# Interpretation  
Outer-region asymmetry is attributed to ram pressure stripping and harassment, scaling with \(\rho_{\mathrm{ICM}} v_{\mathrm{rel}}^{2}\), while inner-region asymmetry aligns with tidal perturbations. Phase-space diagrams classify galaxies by infall history, with higher asymmetry in pericentre regions (Region B) suggesting disruption during first passages. Ancient infallers (Region E) show slightly elevated asymmetry, while backsplash galaxies (Region D) exhibit transient asymmetry. Inner-region asymmetry challenges \(\Lambda\)CDM predictions in some cases, potentially requiring alternative models. Bright galaxies’ asymmetry hints at dust influence, while faint galaxies’ susceptibility reflects environmental effects like harassment and tidal stripping.  

# Implication  
The findings highlight the transitional phase of dwarf galaxies evolving toward quiescence under environmental processes in the Fornax cluster. Outer-region dwarfs retain active star formation, while inner-region dwarfs experience tidal quenching. The results underscore the role of cluster dynamics in shaping morphology, with implications for understanding galaxy evolution in dense environments. Future work will extend this analysis to other clusters using Euclid ERO data and studies like Marleau et al. (2024), advancing our knowledge of environmental effects across cosmic time.
