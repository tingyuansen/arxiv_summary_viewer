# Background  
The primary source of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons for cosmic reionization remains controversial due to insufficient constraints on contributions from galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While galaxies could produce sufficient LyC photons with an escape fraction \(f_{\text{esc}}\) exceeding 10-15\%, the average \(f_{\text{esc}}\) for lower-redshift galaxies is only a few percent. Direct detection of LyC emission from high-redshift objects is hindered by intergalactic medium (IGM) absorption. The UV luminosity function (LF) of luminous AGNs is well-established, but the faint end remains uncertain. Recent JWST discoveries of faint AGN candidates, including 'little-red-dots' (LRDs), suggest a potentially higher AGN spatial density at the faint end, raising the possibility of a significant AGN role in ionizing photon production.  

# Motivation  
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has identified a high density of AGN candidates at high redshift, increasing the potential influence of AGNs on cosmic reionization. This study aims to establish a definitive upper bound on the AGN contribution to reionization, addressing the debate over whether AGNs could dominate the ionizing photon budget during the epoch of reionization (EoR).  

# Methodology  
Using JWST NIRCam data from the GOODS fields, a sample of 156 objects at \(7.15 \leq z \leq 7.75\) was constructed with high completeness. JWST image reduction utilized raw uncal.fits files processed via the JWST Calibration Pipeline (v.1.12.5), CEERS NIRCam imaging reduction scripts, and custom codes. Stage 1 corrected detector-level issues, Stage 2 applied flat-fielding and flux calibration, and Stage 3 created mosaics with \(0.03''\) pixel scale. Objects were decomposed into point-source (assumed AGNs) and extended components in rest-frame far-UV images using GalfitM, with a PSF constructed from stacked point sources and a SÃ©rsic profile (\(n < 5\)) for extended components. The AGN UV LF was measured using \(M_{1450}\) magnitudes derived from F115W and F150W bands, with \(k\)-corrections from simulated quasar spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Completeness was estimated via photometric error simulations, and the LF was parametrized using a double power-law (DPL) with a fixed bright-end slope \(\beta = -2.78\).  

# Results  
The AGN UV LF yielded best-fit parameters \(\alpha=-1.70_{-0.25}^{+0.44}\) and \(M_{1450}^{*}=-17.81_{-1.35}^{+1.06}\) mag, with normalization \(\Phi^{*} = 10^{-3.7} \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \mathrm{mag}^{-1}\). The AGN LF is higher than extrapolated bright quasar LFs but lower than galaxy LFs. Assuming a 100\% escape fraction and a broken power-law SED (\(f_{v} \propto v^{-0.61}\) for \(\lambda>912 \AA\); \(f_{v} \propto v^{-1.70}\) for \(\lambda<912 \AA\)), AGNs contribute \(33_{-4}^{+6}\%\) of the required LyC photons for reionization, calculated as \(\dot{N}_{\text{ion}}(z)=10^{50.48}\left(\frac{C}{3}\right) \times\left(\frac{1+z}{7}\right)^{3} \mathrm{Mpc}^{-3} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\) (\(C=3\)). This upper bound rules out AGNs as the dominant ionizing source.  

# Interpretation  
The 33\% AGN contribution represents an absolute upper limit due to conservative assumptions: (1) a 100\% escape fraction, likely overestimated for low-luminosity AGNs, and (2) attributing all point-source flux to AGNs, potentially inflating AGN flux from compact galaxy cores. The lack of a distinct LF 'knee' and large uncertainties in \(M_{1450}^{*}\) do not affect the ionizing photon calculation. These results confirm that galaxies dominate the ionizing photon budget during the EoR.  

# Implication  
The study conclusively rules out AGNs as the primary drivers of cosmic reionization, implicating star-forming galaxies as the dominant ionizing source. Future JWST observations will refine faint AGN LF constraints and improve LyC escape fraction measurements, potentially solidifying this conclusion.
