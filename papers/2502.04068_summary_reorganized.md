# Background  
Boson Stars (BSs) are self-gravitating configurations of complex scalar fields, potentially contributing to dark matter (DM). The study focuses on massive scalar BSs with a potential \(V(\phi)=\frac{1}{2} m^{2}|\phi|^{2}+\frac{1}{4} \lambda|\phi|^{4}\), particularly in the strong-coupling regime (\(\lambda \gg m^{2} / M_{Pl}^{2}\) or \(\Lambda=\frac{\lambda M_{Pl}^{2}}{4 \pi m^{2}} \gg 1\)), where solutions resemble fermionic stars. In this regime, the system behaves like a perfect fluid with an effective equation of state \(p^{\prime}=\frac{1}{9}(\sqrt{1+3\rho^{\prime}}-1)^{2}\). The parameter space for scalar DM forming massive BSs spans \(10^{-25} \mathrm{eV}<m<100 \mathrm{GeV}\) and \(\lambda \leq 15\), with constraints from CMB/LSS data, dwarf galaxies, and self-interaction cross-sections.  

# Motivation  
The study aims to analyze the fundamental non-radial oscillations (\(f\)-modes) of massive BSs and their gravitational wave (GW) emission, which had not been previously explored. The goal is to derive scaling relations for \(f\)-mode characteristics, establish universal relations for BSs, and identify the detectable parameter space for current and next-generation GW detectors like LISA, LIGO, and NEMO.  

# Methodology  
The scalar DM model employs a quartic self-interaction potential \(V(|\phi|)=\frac{1}{2} m^{2}|\phi|^{2}+\frac{1}{4} \lambda|\phi|^{4}\). In the strong-interaction limit (\(\Lambda>1000\)), BS properties are scaled as \(f=f^{\prime}/(x M_{Pl})\) and \(\tau=\tau^{\prime}(x M_{Pl})\), where \(x=\sqrt{\lambda}/m^{2}\). The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations are solved to derive analytical fits for mass-radius relations, compactness, and \(f\)-mode frequencies. The parameter space is constrained using observational data (CMB/LSS, dwarf galaxies) and self-interaction bounds. Universal relations connecting \(f\)-mode frequencies, tidal deformability (\(\Lambda\)), and compactness (\(C\)) are explored, alongside GW detectability calculations using strain amplitude \(h(t)\) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) \(\rho = h_0 \sqrt{\tau/2S_n}\).  

# Results  
Analytical fits for scaled mass-radius relations and compactness in the strong-interaction limit are derived, with \(M_{\max}^{\prime}=0.06\), \(C_{\max}=0.16\), and \(R_{\max}^{\prime}=0.625\). The \(f\)-mode frequency \(f^{\prime}\) and damping time \(\tau^{\prime}\) are scaled as \(f^{\prime}=f x M_{Pl}\) and \(\tau^{\prime}=\tau / x M_{Pl}\), with hyperbola fits accurate to within \(3\%\). Universal relations for BSs include \(f(\mathrm{kHz})=-0.0045+0.21\sqrt{GM/R^3}\) and \(\frac{R^4}{M^3\tau}=0.111-0.386C\), distinct from neutron stars (NSs). The \(f\)-Love-\(C\) relations show errors <1%, and the dimensionless tidal deformability \(\Lambda\) decreases with mass, reaching \(\Lambda_{\text{min}}=280\). The detectable parameter space for \(f\)-modes is mapped against GW detectors, with thresholds \(x \leq 1.33 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{MeV}^{-2}\) (NEMO), \(5.32 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{MeV}^{-2}\) (LIGO), and \(2.66 \times 10^2 \, \text{MeV}^{-2}\) (LISA). The minimum damping time is \(\tau_{\min} = 1900 x M_{Pl}\), and the maximum BS mass spans \(M_{\max} = 0.06 x M_{Pl}^3\). Detection thresholds (\(\rho \geq 5\)) indicate LISA’s sensitivity to low-frequency, high-mass BSs, while next-gen detectors (CE, ET) enhance detectability within \(\approx 2\) AU for \(E=10^{-10} M_{\odot}\).  

# Interpretation  
The strong-interaction regime (\(\Lambda \gg 1\)) allows BSs to mimic fermionic stars, with universal relations for \(f\)-modes and tidal deformability providing a robust framework for asteroseismology. These relations, independent of model parameters \((\lambda, m)\), enable distinction between BSs and NSs. The derived scaling laws and analytical fits align with prior studies but extend to the strong-coupling limit. Detectability analyses suggest LISA’s capability to probe high-mass BSs, while CE and ET improve sensitivity across the DM parameter space.  

# Implication  
The study’s scaling relations and universal \(f\)-mode characteristics facilitate future detection of BSs via GW observations. Extensions to other interaction potentials (e.g., axion, vector bosons) and exotic compact objects (ECOs) are proposed. Stochastic GW backgrounds from BS binaries and long-lived \(f\)-modes could be probed by upcoming detectors like DECIGO and TianGO. The invariance of tidal Love numbers under scaling transformations supports universal relations for tidal deformability, aiding in distinguishing BSs from NSs. These findings advance GW asteroseismology as a tool to probe DM properties and compact object interiors.
