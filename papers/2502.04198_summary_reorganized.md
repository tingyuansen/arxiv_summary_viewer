# Background  
Galaxy clusters significantly influence the properties and evolution of their member galaxies, including star formation rates, morphology, and AGN activity. Interactions such as ram pressure stripping and galaxy-galaxy harassment alter these properties. AGN, powered by supermassive black holes, are particularly affected, with radio-AGN showing distinct morphological changes in dense environments. Cluster-cluster mergers further disturb the intra-cluster medium (ICM), potentially triggering AGN activity and altering radio-AGN morphology. While the impact of mergers on the ICM is well-documented, their effect on cluster galaxies, especially AGN, remains unclear.  

# Motivation  
This study investigates how merging cluster environments influence radio-AGN morphology and their detection across radio and optical wavelengths, using data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) and Zooniverse.  

# Methodology  
The study uses a galaxy cluster sample from Bilton et al. (2020), derived from SDSS DR8, constrained by X-ray luminosity \(1 < L_X \leq 20 \times 10^{44} \mathrm{erg} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\) to ensure massive, well-assembled clusters. Cluster memberships were determined via surface caustics, with dynamical states classified using the Dressler & Shectman \(\Delta\)-test. AGN identification employed WHAN diagrams, using \(\mathrm{H}\alpha\) and [NII] \(\lambda 6584\) emission lines, with thresholds \(\log_{10}([\mathrm{NII}]/\mathrm{H}\alpha) \geq -0.32\) and \(\mathrm{EW}_{\mathrm{H}\alpha} \geq 6 \AA\). LoTSS data at 144 MHz with \(6^{\prime\prime}\) resolution was used to analyze radio properties.  

A visual classification scheme categorized radio sources as Weak Compact (WC), Strong Compact (SC), Compact Extended (CE), FRI, FRII, FRM, Extended (E), Bent Tail (BT), Head Tail (HT), Undetermined, Bad Data, or No Detection. Five team members classified 191 radio-detected sources via Zooniverse, blinded to cluster dynamical states. Consensus levels for classifications were defined based on inter-classifier agreement. Compact radio sources were filtered to distinguish AGN from star formation using a \(3\times\) threshold comparing \(L_{150 \mathrm{MHz}}\) to star-formation-derived \(L_{150 \mathrm{MHz}, \mathrm{SF}}\). Bayesian credible intervals and Jeffreys intervals were used to compare proportions of radio morphologies in merging versus non-merging clusters.  

# Results  
Non-merging clusters show proportions \(0.59_{-0.08}^{+0.08}\) (Compact) and \(0.16_{-0.05}^{+0.07}\) (Compact Extended), while merging clusters exhibit \(0.53_{-0.12}^{+0.12}\) (Compact) and \(0.06_{-0.04}^{+0.07}\) (Compact Extended), with no significant differences (\(\sigma<1\)). Extended sources are exclusive to non-mergers (\(0.14_{-0.06}^{+0.06}\)). Mergers show significantly more Disturbed sources (\(0.29_{-0.10}^{+0.11}\)) than non-mergers (\(0.03_{-0.02}^{+0.04}\)) at \(3\sigma\). Mergers also exhibit marginally more radio-only AGN (\(2\sigma\)) than radio+optical AGN (\(\operatorname{Pr}(\mathrm{AGN}_{\text{Rad}} > \mathrm{AGN}_{\text{Rad-Opt}}) = 0.96\)).  

# Interpretation  
The \(3\sigma\) increase in disturbed radio sources in mergers is likely due to ICM bulk motion and ram pressure bending radio jets. Head-tail systems, indicative of extreme ram pressure, are exclusively found in mergers. The prevalence of WATs in mergers suggests bent morphology arises from cluster-cluster interactions rather than host galaxy motion. Radio-only AGN in mergers may link to low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs). Uncertainties exist in dynamical state determination, with potential misclassifications based on X-ray or radio halo observations.  

# Implication  
Future work could explore HERG/LERG classification, phase space distributions, larger cluster samples, and undetermined morphologies. A multiwavelength approach is optimal for determining dynamical states, though data uniformity challenges persist. The use of global RMS for LoTSS cutout contours may miss low-surface-brightness emission but does not affect core results. The study highlights the need to reconcile dynamical state classifications across wavelengths and improve AGN identification methods in dense environments.
