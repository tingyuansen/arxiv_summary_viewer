# Background  
Thin stellar streams, such as those of Palomar 5, are formed by tidal disruption of globular clusters or dwarf galaxies and trace the gravitational potential of their host galaxies. Differential gravitational forces stretch these systems into long tidal tails, first predicted in the 1970s and observed in the 1990s with discoveries like the Sagittarius stream and Palomar 5’s tails. Palomar 5, a low-mass globular cluster, has tails extending over 20 degrees, containing more mass than the cluster itself. Advances in surveys like SDSS, Pan-STARRS, and Gaia have enabled the discovery of dozens of streams, allowing detailed orbital and chemical characterization. These streams probe the Milky Way’s gravitational field, including its dark matter halo, with studies revealing both triaxial and spherical halo shapes at different distances. Streams also constrain the granularity of dark matter sub-halos predicted by \(\Lambda\)CDM models, with gaps in streams like Palomar 5 and GD-1 attributed to sub-halo interactions. However, baryonic structures, such as the Galactic bar and giant molecular clouds, can also create stream gaps, complicating interpretations.  

# Motivation  
Recent studies suggest that globular clusters’ impact on stellar streams is negligible, but this may not hold for inner Galaxy streams like Palomar 5, where clusters are densely populated. Ishchenko et al. (2023b) demonstrated that cluster collisions are plausible, implying stream interactions could be frequent. This work aims to quantify globular clusters’ effects on Palomar 5’s stream, simulating interactions with 165 Galactic clusters to challenge prior claims that cluster passages are rare.  

# Methodology  
The study models Palomar 5’s stream using the restricted three-body problem, incorporating key extra-cluster physics like disk shocking. Initial conditions for 165 clusters are derived from Baumgardt & Vasiliev (2021), converted to a Galactocentric frame. The Galactic potential model from Pouliasis et al. (2017) is used, time-independent over 5 Gyr. Mutual \(N\)-body interactions among clusters are modeled as Plummer spheres with masses and radii from the Baumgardt catalog. Initial positions and velocities are integrated backward for 5 Gyr under the Galactic potential and mutual cluster influences. Forward integration simulates Palomar 5’s evolution using 100,000 particles, accounting for gravitational effects from the Galaxy and all clusters, excluding self-gravity. The process is repeated 50 times with Monte-Carlo sampling to handle uncertainties in cluster properties. A leapfrog integrator with a 10,000-year time-step ensures numerical stability, and reverse integrability tests confirm precision. Reference simulations exclude mutual cluster interactions to isolate their impact.  

# Results  
Globular clusters significantly affect Palomar 5’s stream, creating observable gaps in its density profile. Simulations reveal 73 gaps, averaging 1.5 per simulation, with 65 in the leading tail and 8 in the trailing tail. Gaps, such as those induced by NGC 2808, NGC 7078, and NGC 104, form due to close passages, with recent interactions producing narrower gaps. The gap creation rate, \(\mathcal{R}_{\text{Pal 5}}\), is derived by normalizing gap occurrences over time and stream length, yielding a weighted mean of \(0.009 \, \text{km s}^{-1} \text{kpc}^{-2}\). Gaps are predominantly caused by close encounters with impact parameters <200 pc, while gaps are absent for parameters >300 pc. The change in momentum (\(\Delta p\)) imparted by gap-producing flybys is ~10x higher than non-gap encounters, with \(\Delta p \approx 2 \frac{GM}{b\delta v}\), where \(M\) is the perturber’s mass, \(b\) the impact parameter, and \(\delta v\) the relative velocity. Gap-causing clusters are confined to an energy range of -2 to \(-1 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~km}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}\) and follow both direct and retrograde orbits. Gap impacts occur at all orbital phases, but their frequency decreases with galactocentric radius, following \(N=-2.5 r+50\), suggesting cluster density near the Galactic center drives gap formation.  

# Interpretation  
Simulations show Palomar 5’s stream likely experienced multiple globular cluster encounters in the last 5 Gyr, creating gaps up to a few kpc wide. While 73 gaps were found in 50 realizations, only ~22 extend beyond the observed stream length, averaging at least one gap per simulation. Observational challenges, such as field star contamination and magnitude limits, complicate gap detection, suggesting our results may represent an upper limit. Globular clusters’ historical masses were likely higher, implying more perturbers and gaps in the past. These findings contrast with Banik & Bovy (2019), who found negligible globular cluster impact, potentially due to their focus on power spectra rather than individual gaps. Similarly, Doke & Hattori (2022) concluded low gap-creation likelihood for GD-1, but this may not apply to Palomar 5 due to its closer Galactic pericenter.  

# Implication  
The study demonstrates that baryonic components, such as globular clusters, can create gaps in stellar streams, challenging the assumption that such gaps solely indicate dark matter sub-halo interactions. This complicates interpretations of dark matter distribution in the Milky Way, particularly in inner Galaxy regions where baryonic effects dominate. Future studies should extend this analysis to other streams and incorporate evolving Galactic potentials and cluster populations to refine constraints on dark matter sub-halo properties. The results underscore the need to account for baryonic perturbers in stream morphology studies.
