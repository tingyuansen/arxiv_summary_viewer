# Background  
The central molecular zone (CMZ) of the Galaxy, the inner 500 pc, hosts a massive (\(>10^{7} M_{\odot}\)), dense (\(>10^{4} \mathrm{cm}^{-3}\)) gas reservoir with inefficient star formation. It exhibits widespread SiO and complex organic molecule (COM) emissions, with parsec-scale shocks evidenced by broad molecular line widths (\(5-10 \mathrm{km/s}\)). These shocks are thought to heat the gas, decouple gas and dust temperatures, and drive "hot-core like" chemistry. High-resolution ALMA observations have revealed filamentary structures in CMZ clouds, but none directly linked to shocks.  

# Motivation  
The origins of shocks in the CMZ remain unclear, unlike in the Galactic disk where they are attributed to cloud collisions. Previous studies have not conclusively identified shock-driven filamentary structures in the CMZ, motivating high-resolution ALMA observations to investigate the dynamical and chemical processes underlying SiO and COM emissions.  

# Methodology  
Using ALMA’s C40-3 and C40-5 configurations, four CMZ clouds (\(20 \mathrm{km/s}\) cloud, \(50 \mathrm{km/s}\) cloud, cloud e, Sgr C) were observed at \(217-221 \mathrm{GHz}\) and \(231-235 \mathrm{GHz}\). Data reduction with CASA’s **tclean** task achieved a synthesized beam of \(0^{\prime \prime}.28 \times 0^{\prime \prime}.19\) (\(2200 \mathrm{AU} \times 1500 \mathrm{AU}\)) and a spectral rms of \(1.6-2.0 \mathrm{mJy/beam}\). Nine molecular lines, including SiO 5-4, \(c^{6}C_{3}H_{2}\), \(H_{2}CO\), and \(CH_{3}OH\), were detected. Filament skeletons were identified using FilFinder with a Medial Axis Transform method, applying thresholds for integrated intensity (\(>3 \sigma_{\text{area}}\)) and minimum area (125 pixels\(^2\)). Molecular column densities were calculated assuming LTE and optically thin emission using \(N_{\text {tot }}=\frac{8 \pi k_{\mathrm{B}} v^{2}}{h c^{3} A_{u l}} \frac{Q\left(T_{\mathrm{ex}}\right)}{g_{u}} \exp \left(\frac{E_{u}}{k_{\mathrm{B}} T_{\mathrm{ex}}}\right) \int T_{B} d v\), with spectroscopic parameters from CDMS, JPL, and LAMDA databases.  

# Results  
Slim filaments—long (\(>0.5 \mathrm{pc}\)), narrow (\(<0.03 \mathrm{pc}\)) structures—were detected in SiO 5-4 and eight other molecular lines, undetected in continuum. These filaments exhibit coherent velocities within \(\pm 5 \mathrm{km/s}\) of the cloud’s \(V_{\text{LSR}}\), inconsistent with outflows. Their average deconvolved width (0.024 pc) is narrower than nearby filaments, with velocity dispersions (\(\sigma_v\)) of 3.7–5.6 km/s (FWHM: 8.9–13.2 km/s). Position-velocity diagrams show no significant gradients, ruling out outflow origins. Relative molecular abundances resemble protostellar outflows (\(p=0.68\)), distinct from dense cores (\(p=0.02\)). Integrated maps of shock-tracing molecules (e.g., SO, \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}\), \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CN}\)) and Gaussian fits to SiO 5-4 spectra corroborate shock-driven kinematics.  

# Interpretation  
The slim filaments challenge hydrostatic equilibrium models, as turbulent pressure (\(P_{\text{turb}} \approx 1.7 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{K\,cm}^{-3}\)) dominates over self-gravity (\(P_{\text{gravity}} \approx 1.3 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{K\,cm}^{-3}\)), indicating transient dynamics with a dissipation timescale of \(\sim 5.2 \times 10^{3}\) years. Their SiO abundances and Class I \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OH}\) masers suggest shock-driven origins, likely from interactions between magnetized clouds and parsec-scale shocks. Magnetic fields nearly perpendicular to filament skeletons align with shock compression models. The absence of dust emission may result from dust destruction or diffuse initial conditions.  

# Implication  
These filaments represent a new class of structures sustained by parsec-scale shocks, replenishing SiO and COMs (\(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OH}\), \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CN}, \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}, \mathrm{HC}_{3} \mathrm{N}\)) in the CMZ. The estimated SiO replenishment rate (\(\sim 1.3 \times 10^{-4} M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\)) and surface density (\(\sim 0.7 \mathrm{pc}^{-2}\)) suggest they balance SiO depletion, maintaining widespread emissions. This process highlights the role of dynamic shock interactions in shaping CMZ chemistry and turbulence.
