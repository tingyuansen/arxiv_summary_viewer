# Background  
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has identified a population of compact, reddish objects with broad line emission features, termed little red dots (LRDs), at \(z=4-10\). These objects challenge our understanding of early universe AGN and galaxy formation. Their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) suggest they could be either extremely starbursting galaxies or highly obscured AGN. If star formation (SF) dominates, their inferred stellar masses (\(10^{10}-10^{11} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\)) are unusually large for such redshifts. However, spectroscopic evidence, including narrow unresolved lines like [O III], points toward LRDs being dust-reddened AGN with bolometric luminosities \(L_{\text{bol}}=10^{43-46} \mathrm{erg} \mathrm{s}^{-1}\) and BH masses \(10^{6}-10^{8} M_{\odot}\). Their cosmic abundance (\(\sim 10^{-5} \mathrm{Mpc}^{-3} \mathrm{mag}^{-1}\)) is significantly higher than quasars at similar redshifts. X-ray detections are rare, and current radio surveys (e.g., Meerkat, VLA) have not detected LRDs, suggesting they are likely radio-quiet AGN.  

# Motivation  
LRDs offer critical insights into AGN-galaxy coevolution, BH seeding, and cosmic reionization. JWST NIR observations remain inconclusive, and existing radio surveys lack the sensitivity to confirm their nature. Future observations with ngVLA and SKA could resolve their properties. This work aims to estimate radio emission from LRDs to guide upcoming surveys and determine whether their radio signals originate from AGN activity or host galaxy processes.  

# Methodology  
Radio flux at \(0.1-10 \mathrm{GHz}\) from BHs in LRDs is estimated using the fundamental plane (FP) of BH accretion, relating nuclear radio luminosity (\(L_{\mathrm{R}}\)), BH mass (\(M_{\mathrm{BH}}\)), and X-ray luminosity (\(L_{\mathrm{X}}\)) at 2-10 keV: \(\log L_{\mathrm{R}} = A \log L_{\mathrm{X}} + B \log M_{\mathrm{BH}} + C\). Coefficients \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) account for radio-loud and radio-quiet sources. Using \(L_{\mathrm{X}}\) upper limits (\(10^{43}-10^{44} \mathrm{erg} \mathrm{s}^{-1}\)) and \(M_{\mathrm{BH}}\) values (\(10^{6}-10^{7} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\)), \(L_{\mathrm{R}}\) is computed. Observed radio flux is redshifted into ngVLA and SKA bands, assuming a spectral index \(\alpha=0.3\), and calculated via \(F_{v} = \frac{L_{v^{\prime}}(1+z)}{4 \pi d_{\mathrm{L}}^{2}}\). Host galaxy radio emission is estimated using an empirical relation from Delhaize et al. (2017), incorporating redshift dependence and an IMF factor \(f_{IMF}=1.7\). Stellar flux is derived using \(f_{v_{\text{obs}}} = \frac{L_{R}(1+z)^{\alpha+1}}{4 \pi d_{\mathrm{L}}^{2}}\left(\frac{1.4}{v_{\text{obs}}}\right)^{\alpha}\) with \(\alpha=0.7\), assuming SFRs of 1, 10, and \(30 M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\).  

# Results  
In the standard scenario, AGN-to-SFR flux ratios at \(z=7\) range from 0.1-40 for \(\mathrm{SFR}=1 M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\), with AGN dominating except at minimum fluxes. For \(\mathrm{SFR}=10 M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\), ratios drop to 0.02-4, and for \(\mathrm{SFR}=30 M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\), ratios decrease to 0.002-2. AGN radio fluxes range from 1-3000 nJy, decreasing with redshift, while host galaxy fluxes vary from 10-1000 nJy. In radio-loudness scenarios, AGN fluxes (20,000-2,000,000 nJy) dominate across all SFRs. Current surveys (VLASS, FIRST, COSMOS) have not detected radio-loud LRDs, with one detection (~0.15 \(\mu \mathrm{Jy} /\) beam) suggesting radio-quiet AGN. ngVLA could detect AGN with \(M_{\mathrm{BH}} \geq 10^{6.5} M_{\odot}\) at \(z<5\) in 1 hr, while SKA requires ~100 hr. Signals above ~2000 nJy at \(z=3-4\) or ~500 nJy at \(z>5\) would indicate AGN presence.  

# Interpretation  
The results suggest LRDs are likely radio-quiet AGN, aligning with the lack of radio-loud detections in current surveys. AGN fluxes dominate host emissions only at lower SFRs (\(1 M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\)) or higher BH masses (\(10^{7} M_{\odot}\)). Radio-loud scenarios produce detectable fluxes but are inconsistent with existing non-detections. The spectral index \(\alpha\) (0.3â€“0.7) shows minimal impact on conclusions. Super-Eddington accretion scenarios could explain obscuration but do not affect radio emission predictions.  

# Implication  
Future observations with ngVLA and SKA can resolve the nature of LRDs by detecting AGN fluxes above \(\sim 2000 \mathrm{nJy}\) at \(z=3-4\) or \(\sim 500 \mathrm{nJy}\) at \(z>5\), contingent on SFRs \(<30 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\). Confirming radio-quiet AGN in LRDs would advance understanding of early BH growth, AGN-galaxy coevolution, and the role of obscured AGN in cosmic reionization. Current non-detections already constrain radio-loud fractions, emphasizing the need for deeper surveys to probe radio-quiet regimes.
