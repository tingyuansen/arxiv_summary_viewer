# Background  
Dark matter (DM) constitutes approximately 25\% of the universe's energy budget, yet its particle nature remains unknown. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) have been traditional DM candidates, but experimental searches have not confirmed them. Scalar particles like axions and fuzzy DM have emerged as alternative bosonic DM candidates. Boson stars (BSs), self-gravitating configurations of bosonic particles, are exotic compact objects (ECOs) that could mimic black holes (BHs) or neutron stars (NSs). Gravitational wave (GW) detection offers a novel method to probe non-accreting BSs.  

# Motivation  
The discovery of the Higgs boson and predictions of scalar particles have shifted focus to light bosonic DM. If BSs exist, they could contribute significantly to the DM budget and transform our understanding of compact objects. Distinguishing BSs from BHs and NSs through GW observations of \(f\)-mode oscillations provides a critical opportunity to explore DM parameter space and validate bosonic DM models.  

# Methodology  
Massive BSs are modeled using a self-interacting scalar field with potential \(V(\phi)=\frac{1}{2} m^{2}|\phi|^{2}+\frac{1}{4} \lambda|\phi|^{4}\), where \(m\) is the particle mass and \(\lambda\) is the self-interaction parameter. In the strong-interaction limit (\(\Lambda \equiv \frac{\lambda M_{Pl}^{2}}{4 \pi m^{2}} \gg 1\)), BSs resemble fermionic stars, with mass scaling as \(M_{\max} \propto \sqrt{\lambda} M_{Pl}^{3} / m^{2}\). The effective equation of state is \(p=\frac{m^{4}}{9 \lambda}\left(\sqrt{1+\frac{3 \lambda}{m^{4}}} \rho-1\right)^{2}\). Scaling relations for \(f\)-mode oscillations are derived using full general relativity, incorporating metric perturbations and the Zerilli equation. The Cowling approximation demonstrates scaling invariance, with perturbation functions \(W(r)\) and \(V(r)\) obeying boundary conditions for vanishing pressure at the surface.  

# Results  
The scaled \(f\)-mode frequency \(f^{\prime}=f(x M_{Pl})\) and damping time \(\tau^{\prime}=\tau/(x M_{Pl})\) are universal across the DM parameter space, with \(f_{\max}^{\prime}=0.21\) and \(\tau_{\min}^{\prime}=1900\) for maximum compactness (\(C=0.16\)). The minimum number of oscillations is \(N_{\min}=406\). BS \(f\)-mode frequencies scale as \(f_{BS} = 202.67 f^{\prime}(C) M^{\prime}(C) \left(\frac{M_{\odot}}{M_{BS}}\right) \mathrm{kHz}\), yielding \(f_{BS, \max} = 2.67 \left(\frac{M_{\odot}}{M_{BS}}\right) \mathrm{kHz}\). BSs partially overlap with NSs in the \(f-M\) space but exhibit distinct ratios: \(\mathcal{R}_{BS/BH} = 0.22\) and \(\frac{f_{BS}}{f_{BS}^{ISCO}} = 6.79\) for maximum compactness. BH \(f\)-modes are consistently higher by a factor of 4.5.  

# Interpretation  
The universal scaling relations enable \(f\)-mode calculations for any \((\lambda, m)\) without separate studies. BSs with \(C=0.16\) are distinguishable from BHs via the fixed frequency ratio \(\mathcal{R}_{BS/BH}\), while their higher \(f\)-mode-to-ISCO frequency ratio reduces dynamical tide effects in binaries. Overlap with NSs in mass but divergence in frequency bands allows GW observations to identify BSs.  

# Implication  
These results provide a unified framework to explore the DM parameter space and distinguish BSs from BHs and NSs through GW detections. The scaling relations eliminate the need for redundant studies across parameter values, streamlining future research. This work opens avenues to detect \(f\)-modes, extend analyses to spinning BSs, and investigate higher compactness via \(\phi^n\) potentials (\(n>4\)), advancing the search for bosonic DM and ECOs.
