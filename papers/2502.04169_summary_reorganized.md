# Background  
Hot Jupiters (HJs) are massive planets with short orbital periods, typically on circular, tidally synchronized orbits, leading to permanent daysides and nightsides. Atmospheric models, particularly 3D general circulation models (GCMs), predict a broad superrotating equatorial jet driven by temperature contrasts, shifting the hottest point eastward of the substellar point. Eccentric HJs, such as HD 80606b and HAT-P-2b, experience time-varying stellar irradiation, disrupting synchronous rotation and atmospheric circulation. Previous studies by Kataria et al. (2013) and Lewis et al. (2014) show that eccentricity narrows and strengthens the equatorial jet, induces mid-latitude westward winds, and increases day-night temperature contrasts. Magnetic drag, significant above \(\sim 1500 \mathrm{~K}\), shapes atmospheric dynamics, with non-ideal MHD models revealing time-varying hotspot offsets.  

# Motivation  
This study is the first to couple a GCM with a temperature-dependent magnetic drag prescription for eccentric HJs, addressing the limitations of uniform drag approximations. The work explores the impact of eccentricity and magnetic fields on atmospheric circulation, thermal structure, and emission spectra, providing a comprehensive understanding of eccentric HJ atmospheres.  

# Methodology  
The study employs the 3D RM-GCM, solving primitive equations for atmospheric circulation, coupled with an updated picket fence radiative transfer scheme modeling opacities in five bands. The RM-GCM incorporates kinematic MHD via a temperature-dependent magnetic drag timescale \(\tau_{\text{mag}}\), derived from non-ideal MHD equations and applied as Rayleigh drag in the momentum equation. The model assumes a dipole magnetic field aligned with the planet’s rotation axis, limiting drag to the east-west direction. Five simulations of eccentric TOI-150b (\(e=0.26\)) with varying magnetic field strengths (0G, 3G, 10G, 30G) and one circular model were run for 1000 orbits. Post-processing generates high-resolution (\(R=100,000\)) and low-resolution (\(R=150\)) emission spectra, focusing on CO as a tracer molecule. Chemical equilibrium and solar abundances are assumed, with opacities sourced from the ExoMol database. Cloud modeling uses EGP+, a 1D radiative-convective model, with three cloud cases varying particle size and vertical extent via sedimentation efficiency \(f_{\text{sed}}=3,1,0.5\), alongside a cloud-free scenario.  

# Results  
Eccentricity induces high-latitude westward winds, narrows the equatorial jet, and causes phase-dependent thermal inversions, with inversions strongest near periastron. Magnetic drag alters circulation, with stronger fields (10G, 30G) weakening the equatorial jet and extending westward winds to mid-latitudes. Magnetic drag amplifies temperature inversions near periastron, as radiative timescales \(\tau_{rad} = \frac{P}{g} \frac{c_p}{4 \sigma T^3}\) dominate over advective timescales \(\tau_{adv} = \frac{R}{U}\). Phase curves show peak flux occurring slightly before periastron, with magnetic drag delaying peak amplitude. High-resolution spectra reveal increased flux near periastron and reduced Doppler broadening with stronger fields, particularly in the 10G and 30G cases. Clouds slightly warm the upper atmosphere near apastron but dissipate near periastron, with TiO inducing thermal inversions near periastron. Low-resolution spectra highlight stronger CO\(_2\) absorption in 3D models due to steeper temperature gradients.  

# Interpretation  
The results confirm that eccentricity and magnetic drag induce temporal variability in atmospheric dynamics, consistent with Kataria et al. (2013) and Mayorga et al. (2021). Magnetic drag weakens zonal winds and enhances meridional flows, altering temperature structures and Doppler shifts. The 10G model exhibits the largest wind variability, indicating phase-dependent atmospheric responses. Assumptions such as a dipole magnetic field, solar metallicity, and pseudo-synchronous rotation limit the model’s generality. Future JWST observations could validate 3D effects, particularly CO\(_2\) and H\(_2\)O features, while advanced radiative transfer and complex magnetic field models could refine predictions.  

# Implication  
Eccentric HJs offer a unique testbed for studying atmospheric dynamics over short timescales. JWST spectra could confirm temperature inversions and differentiate between magnetic models. Phase curves and secondary eclipse observations may reveal day-night contrasts and hotspot offsets, constraining orbital dynamics. The interplay between eccentricity, magnetic fields, and radiative forcing underscores the need for temperature-dependent drag prescriptions in atmospheric models. High-resolution spectroscopy can probe inter-orbit variability, with reduced Doppler shifts in magnetically active cases (e.g., 30G shows \(0.25 \mathrm{~km/s}\) blueshift), providing observational benchmarks for future studies.
