# Background  
Drone-based beam calibration offers a novel solution for precise 21 cm cosmology telescope calibration, addressing challenges in foreground removal and beam pattern mapping. The TONE array, a CHIME/FRB outrigger pathfinder, consists of eight 6 m dishes operating at 400–800 MHz, instrumented with CHIME or HIRAX feeds. Traditional calibration methods face difficulties in achieving high-resolution beam maps and polarization leakage characterization.  

# Motivation  
The motivation is to develop a drone-based system for 400–800 MHz radio observatories that enables precise beam mapping, polarization alignment analysis, and RFI mitigation. This system aims to overcome limitations in existing calibration techniques by providing 2D high-resolution co- and cross-polarized beam maps, essential for understanding beam pattern distortions and polarization leakage in 21 cm cosmology experiments.  

# Methodology  
The drone calibration system employs a DJI Matrice 600 Pro equipped with a 400–800 MHz broadband calibration payload, including a noise source, RF switch, and biconical antenna. Positional accuracy is enhanced by an RTK ground station, achieving 20–30 minute flights at ~200 m altitude. Flight plans are executed via UgCS software, with telemetry data processed using DatCon. The payload generates a switched calibration signal (400 ms pulsed white-noise with 50% duty cycle), enabling background subtraction with a 200 ms cadence. A UBlox RTK GPS ensures timing synchronization, while a 95 dB ENR noise source attenuated to 49–59 dB provides dynamic range for the TONE correlator.  

Data processing involves identifying the pulsed calibration signal, applying timing corrections via 2D Gaussian fitting, gridding data into Cartesian or polar coordinates, and normalizing sidelobe and main beam flights. Background subtraction uses rolling averages of 20 background points to mitigate slow RFI and gain drifts. Timing offsets up to 4.5 s are corrected by maximizing Pearson-R correlation. Gaussian fits \(G(x, y) = A e^{-\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\sigma_x^2} - \frac{(y-y_0)^2}{2\sigma_y^2}} + C\) center beam maps, with radial distance corrections \(\left(r(t)/r_0\right)^2\) applied for \(1/r^2\) brightness drop-off. Normalization scales non-reference flights to a reference flight (e.g., flight 618 for North polarization) using annulus regions.  

Twelve analyzed flights (out of 48) included main beam (100 m width) and sidelobe (200 m width) measurements, with grid spacing optimized for battery life. Front-end filters mitigated RFI from the drone’s communication signals. The ICEboard FPGA system digitized and correlated signals into 1024 frequency bins at 400–800 MHz, with 42 ms integration for high SNR.  

# Results  
Drone measurements of four TONE dishes revealed co-polarized beam patterns with first and second sidelobes at ~12° (-20 dB) and ~25° (-25 dB), respectively. Statistical errors were 7–9% (main beam), 9% (first sidelobe), and ~70% (second sidelobe). Main beam FWHM decreased from 8.5° at 450 MHz to 6° at 600 MHz, differing from prior celestial calibration results. Cross-polarized amplitudes ranged from -23.5 dB to -12.5 dB relative to co-polarized peaks, with North-polarized inputs consistently higher than East-polarized.  

Simulations using CST software showed qualitative agreement in sidelobe locations but discrepancies in main beam ellipticity and sidelobe definition. Measured sidelobe power exceeded simulations, likely due to unmodeled dish deformations. HIRAX feeds exhibited polarization angle deviations above 600 MHz, traced to an antenna design asymmetry, while CHIME feeds maintained orthogonality. RFI measurements identified intentional (drone controller, telemetry) and unintentional (motors, power supplies) emissions exceeding MeerKAT limits by up to 45.65 dB.  

# Interpretation  
The higher sidelobe levels in data compared to simulations suggest unmodeled dish deformations or feed misalignment. The asymmetric dip between the main beam and first sidelobe in Cartesian gridding and elongated cross-polarized structures likely arise from dish geometry and feed design. HIRAX feed deviations above 600 MHz indicate a critical design flaw, prompting a redesign. The drone’s transmitting antenna beam pattern (Ludwig-I conventions) caused systematic underestimations of sidelobe levels by 14% (first sidelobe) and 47% (second sidelobe), exceeding statistical errors.  

# Implication  
This work demonstrates the first drone-based 2D cross-polarized beam maps and polarization angle alignment investigation, highlighting feed design improvements for future telescopes. The broad-band switching calibrator and RFI mitigation strategies provide a framework for deployments in radio-quiet zones. Systematic errors from transmitting antenna patterns and polarization conventions necessitate updates for precision cosmology. Future efforts must address ADC saturation in sidelobe flights, RFI compliance (e.g., shifting communications to 5 GHz), and dish deformation modeling to align simulations with observations.
