# Background  
The Kuiper Belt comprises two trans-Neptunian object (TNO) populations: dynamically cold TNOs, formed in-situ at \(\sim 45\) au, and hot TNOs, likely originating closer to the Sun (\(\sim 20\) au) before implantation via giant planet migration. Cold TNOs exhibit low inclinations, redder colors, and higher binary fractions, while hot TNOs show higher inclinations, neutral colors, and include more massive bodies like dwarf planets. Recent surveys (OSSOS, DEEP) reveal similar size distributions for cold and hot TNOs at low masses (\(H_{r} \gtrsim 5\)), consistent with streaming instability (SI). However, the high-mass end of the hot population's distribution is flattened, likely due to pebble accretion, which operated in the primordial belt but not in the cold population.  

# Motivation  
The study aims to explain the flattened high-mass tail of hot TNOs, quantify pebble accretion parameters (\(\tau_{s}\), \(\Delta v\), turbulent diffusivity \(\alpha_{D}\)), and link the observed size distribution to formation mechanisms. Pebble accretion, sensitive to disk conditions, is proposed to explain the growth of massive TNOs in a gas-rich disk before dynamical instability implanted them into the trans-Neptunian region. The work evaluates whether pebble accretion in environments resembling ALMA rings can reconcile the observed TNO mass function with solar system formation models.  

# Methodology  
The present-day mass distribution of dynamically hot TNOs within 48 au (P48) is reconstructed using Minor Planet Center (MPC) data, excluding cold classicals and Haumea family members. Dim TNOs (\(H_{r}>5\)) are modeled using a debiased OSSOS++ distribution fit by a broken power law. Pebble accretion rates depend on mass density (\(\rho_{\text{peb}}\)), relative velocity (\(\Delta v\)), and gravitational focusing, modulated by the stopping time (\(\tau_{s}\)) and turbulence. The model integrates growth via ordinary differential equations, normalized by solar mass and time \(t_0\), until pebble reservoir depletion. Parameters include initial mass distribution (\(m_{\text{brk}}\), \(m_{\text{imf}}\)), pebble properties (\(\sigma\), \(\tau_{s}\), \(m_{\text{Peb}}\)), and velocity fields (laminar or turbulent). Likelihood functions combine Gaussian and binomial statistics for OSSOS++ and MPC data, with priors constraining total pre-instability belt mass (\(14-28 m_{\oplus}\)) and individual body masses (\(\lesssim 1 m_{\oplus}\)). MCMC analysis marginalizes over parameters to fit observations.  

# Results  
MCMC fits favor pebble accretion dominating above \(m_{*} \sim 10^{-5} m_{\oplus}\), flattening the high-mass TNO distribution. Laminar models (lami-1p) show strong \(\tau_{s}\)-\(\Delta v\) correlations, favoring \(\tau_{s} \sim 10^{-2}\) and accretion times \(\sim 0.1–1\) Myr. Turbulent models require low \(\tau_{s}\), disfavored due to long accretion times inconsistent with gas-rich disk lifetimes. Simulations accrete \(5-8 m_{\oplus}\) of pebbles, aligning with initial mass function (IMF) constraints. Models overshoot observations at \(m=10^{-4} m_{\oplus}\) and undershoot at \(m=3 \times 10^{-3} m_{\oplus}\), reflecting statistical uncertainties. Adding a secondary pebble component does not improve fits (Bayes factors: 0.54 laminar, 0.18 turbulent).  

# Interpretation  
The high-mass flattening arises from pebble accretion, which becomes efficient at \(m \sim 0.1 m_{*}\). Laminar models align with smooth disks (\(\eta \approx 5 \times 10^{-3}\)), while turbulent models correspond to ALMA-like pebble rings at pressure maxima (\(\eta \approx 0\)). Pebble accretion in laminar disks is inefficient due to small \(\tau_{s}\) (\(7 \times 10^{-4}\)) and long drift timescales (\(\sim 2\) Myr), requiring implausibly high pebble masses (\(>500 m_{\oplus}\)). Turbulent rings with \(\alpha_{D} \sim 10^{-3}\) and \(\tau_{s} \sim 0.01\) reconcile accretion timescales (\(\sim 0.4\) Myr) with disk lifetimes. The cold classical belt’s low mass (\(\sim 10^{-4} \times\) primordial belt) and distance (\(\sim 40\) au) hinder pebble accretion, favoring late formation or ring-based growth.  

# Implication  
Pebble accretion in ALMA-like rings explains the hot TNO mass distribution, with constraints \(\tau_{s} \sim 0.01\), \(\alpha_{D} \sim 10^{-3}\), and \(v_{\text{frag}} \sim 2\) m/s. These rings consume \(\sim 10 m_{\oplus}\) of pebbles within \(\sim 0.4\) Myr, consistent with disk lifetimes. Massive TNOs (\(m_{\text{final}} > 10^{-4} m_{\oplus}\), Orcus-sized) likely meet dwarf planet criteria due to isotropic pebble settling forming spherical bodies. Future surveys (CLASSY, Vera C. Rubin Observatory) will refine accretion models by expanding high-mass TNO samples. The cold belt’s primordial low-mass distribution contrasts with the hot population’s pebble-modified profile, underscoring distinct formation pathways.
