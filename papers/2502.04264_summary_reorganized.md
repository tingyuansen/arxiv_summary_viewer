# Background  
Gravitational wave (GW) detections from binary neutron star (NS) mergers provide new constraints on the equations of state (EoSs) of dense matter. Neutron star oscillations, particularly fundamental (\(f\)-) modes, emit gravitational waves detectable by observatories like LIGO/VIRGO and the Einstein Telescope. The relativistic Cowling approximation, used in this study, differs from a full general relativistic treatment by less than 20%. Tidal deformability (\(\Lambda\)) derived from GW signals further constrains EoSs. The modified chiral model, incorporating higher-order mesonic interactions, addresses the softening effect of exotic matter while maintaining stiff EoSs for massive NS configurations.  

# Motivation  
The study investigates \(f\)-mode oscillations in NSs containing hyperons and delta (\(\Delta\)) baryons to understand their role in GW emissions and EoS properties. It aims to reconcile the presence of exotic matter with the requirement for stiff EoSs to support observed NS masses. The analysis leverages tidal deformability constraints from GW events and aims to provide insights into the internal composition of NSs through \(f\)-mode frequency measurements.  

# Methodology  
The study employs a modified effective chiral model with an isospin-dependent Lagrangian involving nucleons, hyperons, \(\Delta\) baryons, and mesons (\(\pi\), \(\sigma\), \(\rho\), \(\omega\)). The model includes mesonic cross-couplings (e.g., \(\sigma\)-\(\rho\) coupling parameterized by \(\eta_{1}\)) and spontaneous symmetry breaking, defining baryon and meson masses. Equations of state (EoSs) for hyperon-rich (\(H\)) and \(\Delta\)-matter are computed under charge neutrality and chemical equilibrium. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations solve for NS structure, while the Cowling approximation analyzes non-radial \(f\)-mode oscillations. Eigen frequencies \(\omega\) are determined via Ridders’s method, and tidal deformability \(\Lambda\) is calculated using Love numbers \(k_{2}\). Empirical relations link \(f\)-mode frequencies to mass, radius, and \(\Lambda\).  

# Results  
The \(\Delta\) EoS is stiffer than the \(H\) EoS, exceeding the conformal speed of sound limit \(c_s^2=1/3\) beyond \(2\rho_0\). Maximum NS masses are \(2.03 M_{\odot}\) (\(H\) EoS) and \(2.20 M_{\odot}\) (\(\Delta\) EoS), with radii of 12.11 km and 12.26 km, respectively. For \(1.4 M_{\odot}\) NSs, radii are 13.38 km (\(H\)) and 13.31 km (\(\Delta\)), consistent with NICER and GW170817 data. \(f\)-mode frequencies for \(l=2,3,4\) modes range from 1.84–2.42 kHz, 2.24–3 kHz, and 2.56–3.43 kHz, with higher frequencies for the stiffer \(\Delta\) EoS. Tidal deformability \(\Lambda_{1.4} \sim 800\) aligns with GW190814 constraints. The Love number \(k_{2}\) peaks at 0.137 for \(M \sim 0.9 M_{\odot}\) and decreases to 0.042 (\(H\)) and 0.036 (\(\Delta\)) at maximum mass. A linear fit \(f(\mathrm{kHz}) \approx 1.148 + 1.358 \sqrt{\tilde{M}/\tilde{R}^{3}}\) links \(f\)-modes to NS structure.  

# Interpretation  
The stiffness of the \(\Delta\) EoS arises from stronger couplings (\(x_{\sigma \Delta}=x_{\rho \Delta}=x_{\omega \Delta}=1.2\)) and delayed appearance of \(\Delta\) baryons compared to hyperons. Hyperons soften the EoS by constituting a larger fraction of matter at lower densities. Violations of the conformal limit \(c_s^2=1/3\) in the \(\Delta\) EoS indicate strong interactions, while the \(H\) EoS approaches this limit. Higher compactness (\(C_{\max}=0.266\)) and surface redshift (\(Z_s^{\max}=0.462\)) for the \(\Delta\) EoS reflect its stiffness. Minimal impact of coupling constant variations on maximum mass and \(f\)-mode frequencies suggests robustness in the model.  

# Implication  
The results validate the modified chiral model for describing NSs with exotic matter, aligning with pulsar and GW observational constraints. Future GW detections from binary NS mergers will refine EoS constraints and enhance understanding of \(f\)-mode oscillations. The empirical relations derived here provide a tool to infer NS properties from \(f\)-mode measurements, bridging theoretical models and observational data. The study underscores the importance of exotic baryons in shaping NS structure and GW signatures.
