# Background  
Supernova remnants (SNRs) are key sites for Galactic cosmic ray (CR) acceleration, with pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) being dynamic structures powered by pulsars. These systems emit across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to \(\gamma\)-rays, through processes like hadronic interactions, inverse Compton scattering, and nonthermal bremsstrahlung. Composite SNR CTB 87, associated with the TeV source VER J2016+371, exhibits a filled-centered morphology dominated by synchrotron emission from a PWN. Radio observations reveal a kidney-shaped structure with spectral steepening above 11 GHz, while X-ray studies identify a diffuse nebula around the putative pulsar CXOU J2016+3711, confirmed as PSR J2016+3711 by FAST. CTB 87’s \(\gamma\)-ray emission, first detected by VERITAS, shows interactions with molecular clouds (MCs), suggesting a composite system with hadronic contributions to \(\gamma\)-ray production.

# Motivation  
The study aims to elucidate the nature of \(\gamma\)-ray emission in CTB 87 by distinguishing between hadronic and leptonic processes, confirming its classification as a composite SNR, and identifying the GeV counterpart of VER J2016+371. This addresses gaps in understanding particle acceleration mechanisms and the interplay between SNRs, PWNe, and MCs.

# Methodology  
Fermi-LAT Pass 8 data spanning August 4, 2008, to September 4, 2024 (1 GeV–1 TeV) were analyzed, excluding events with zenith angles > \(90^{\circ}\) to minimize Earth Limb contamination. A \(20^{\circ} \times 20^{\circ}\) region centered on CTB 87 (R.A. \(=304^{\circ} .057\), decl. \(=37^{\circ} .213\)) served as the ROI. Data processing used Fermi Science Tools with the IRF "P8R3_SOURCE_V3" and binned likelihood analysis. Background models included Galactic diffuse (gll_iem_v07.fits) and isotropic (iso_P8R3_SOURCE_V3_v1.txt) components. Sources from the 4FGL-DR4 catalog within \(20^{\circ}\) were incorporated, with free parameters for sources within \(5^{\circ}\). Spatial analysis employed a \(4^{\circ} \times 4^{\circ}\) Test Statistic (TS) map, revealing three new \(\gamma\)-ray sources (NewPS1–3). Spectral analysis used power-law and log-parabola models, with energy-dependent analyses in low (1–30 GeV) and high (30 GeV–1 TeV) ranges.

# Results  
Two distinct GeV \(\gamma\)-ray sources were identified: PsA (soft spectrum, index \(2.902 \pm 0.109\)) and PsB (hard spectrum, index \(1.689 \pm 0.232\)). PsA’s integral photon flux is \((2.69 \pm 0.32) \times 10^{-9}\) photon \(\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\), while PsB’s is \((2.21 \pm 1.46) \times 10^{-10}\) photon \(\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\). Energy-dependent analysis showed PsA dominating the low-energy range (TS = 262.83) and PsB the high-energy range (TS = 28.81). The centroids of \(\gamma\)-ray emission in these ranges were \(0^{\circ} .016\) apart, indicating unresolved components. Spectral curvature tests found no significant improvement with log-parabola models. VER J2016+371’s SED aligns with a leptonic model using a broken power-law electron distribution (\(E_{\text{br}} \sim 9 \, \text{GeV}\), \(\gamma_1 \sim 1.5\), \(\gamma_2 \sim 2.8\)) and magnetic field \(B \sim 7 \, \mu\text{G}\).

# Interpretation  
PsA’s soft spectrum (\(\alpha_p \sim 2.9\)) and total proton energy (\(W_p \sim 5.0 \times 10^{49} \, \text{erg}\)) suggest a hadronic origin from SNR-MC interactions, consistent with systems like IC 443 and W44. PsB’s hard GeV spectrum connects to VER J2016+371’s TeV emission, supporting its identification as a PWN powered by PSR J2016+3711 (\(\dot{E} = 2.2 \times 10^{37} \, \text{erg s}^{-1}\), \(\tau_c = 11.1 \, \text{kyr}\)). The leptonic model for PsB implies a broken power-law electron distribution with \(E_{e,\text{cut}} > 400 \, \text{TeV}\), synchrotron cooling timescales exceeding the pulsar’s age, and a TeV efficiency \(L_{1-10 \, \text{TeV}}/\dot{E} \simeq 0.01\%\), typical of \(\gamma\)-ray PWNe.

# Implication  
The findings classify CTB 87 as a composite SNR with distinct hadronic (PsA) and leptonic (PsB) \(\gamma\)-ray components. Future observations by LHAASO and CTA are critical to resolve unresolved emission, probe the non-detected SNR shock, and refine particle acceleration models. This work advances understanding of SNR-MC interactions and PWN emission mechanisms, highlighting the need for deeper radio and X-ray studies to confirm the relic blast wave hypothesis.
