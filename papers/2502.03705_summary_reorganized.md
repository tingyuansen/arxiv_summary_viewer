# Background  
The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) stars, located at the top of the red giant branch in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, are pivotal for distance measurements and Hubble constant (\(H_0\)) determination. TRGB stars are particularly valued for their near-metallicity independence in the \(I\)-band absolute magnitude (\(M_{\mathrm{I}}\)), making them reliable distance calibrators. However, discrepancies exist between observational studies and theoretical models regarding metallicity dependence, with models predicting metallicity effects on TRGB luminosity. These discrepancies are critical in resolving tensions in \(H_0\) measurements, such as those arising from comparisons between SNe Ia and cosmic microwave background (CMB) results. Theoretical models suggest optical bands exhibit fainter magnitudes, while infrared bands show brighter magnitudes with increasing metallicity, driven by opacity effects.  

# Motivation  
This study aims to resolve inconsistencies between empirical calibrations and theoretical predictions of TRGB luminosity’s metallicity dependence. By leveraging Gaia DR3 data and analyzing TRGB stars in Galactic globular clusters, the work seeks to establish precise relationships between TRGB absolute magnitudes, color indexes, and metallicity across optical and near-infrared bands. The goal is to improve the reliability of TRGB as a standard candle for \(H_0\) measurements and address systematic uncertainties contributing to the Hubble tension.  

# Methodology  
Thirty-three Galactic globular clusters with homogeneous metallicity distributions (\(−2.5 < [\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}] < −0.5\)) were selected from Vasiliev \& Baumgardt (2021), ensuring no systematic bias. Clusters with >1000 stars and single stellar populations in color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) were prioritized. Membership probabilities >90% confirmed stellar associations. TRGB identification in clusters, unlike galaxies, required selecting the reddest RGB stars in CMDs as candidates, accounting for luminosity-magnitude conversion uncertainties and opacity effects in metal-rich clusters. AGB stars and long-period variables (LPVs) with photometric dispersions >0.05 mag were excluded, yielding 37 TRGB stars. Absolute magnitudes in optical (\(G_{\mathrm{BP}}, G_{\mathrm{RP}}, V, I\)) and near-infrared (\(J, H, K_{\mathrm{S}}\)) bands were derived using Gaia parallaxes, historical distances, and crossmatched data from 2MASS and OGLE.  

# Results  
For \([\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}] < -1.2\), \(M_{\mathrm{I}}\) remains nearly constant at \(-4.017 \pm 0.036 \pm 0.027\) mag, yielding \(H_0 = 70.86 \pm 1.2 \pm 0.9\) km/s/Mpc. At higher metallicities, \(M_{\mathrm{I}}\) becomes fainter, increasing \(H_0\). Optical bands (\(G_{\mathrm{BP}}, G_{\mathrm{RP}}, V\)) show magnitudes increasing (fainter) with metallicity, while infrared bands (\(J, H, K_{\mathrm{S}}\)) exhibit inverse trends. Analytical relations derived via least-squares fitting are:  
\[
\begin{gathered}
M_{G_{\mathrm{BP}}}=7.28 \times \exp (2.19 \times[\mathrm{Fe} / \mathrm{H}])-2.40, \\
M_{G_{\mathrm{RP}}}=0.13 \times[\mathrm{Fe} / \mathrm{H}]-3.66, \\
M_{V}=11.29 \times \exp (2.76 \times[\mathrm{Fe} / \mathrm{H}])-2.62, \\
M_{I}=10.47 \times \exp (3.92 \times[\mathrm{Fe} / \mathrm{H}])-4.017, \\
M_{J}=-0.07 \times[\mathrm{Fe} / \mathrm{H}]-5.18, \\
M_{K_{\mathrm{S}}}=-0.34 \times[\mathrm{Fe} / \mathrm{H}]-6.55.
\end{gathered}
\]  
Color indices \((G_{\mathrm{BP}}-G_{\mathrm{RP}}, V-I, J-K_{\mathrm{S}})\) exhibit smaller dispersion than absolute magnitudes. Two TRGB stars with infrared excess suggest circumstellar dust impacts metal-rich stars. Systematic uncertainties from distance, extinction, and photometry contribute 0.027 mag error in \(M_{\mathrm{I}}\).  

# Interpretation  
The metallicity dependence of TRGB luminosity arises from increased opacity in metal-rich stars, shifting black-body radiation to longer wavelengths. This explains the inverse trends between optical and infrared bands. Discrepancies with LMC \(M_{\mathrm{I}}\) measurements (\(−4.038\) to \(−4.047\) mag vs. predicted \(−3.7\) mag) likely reflect metallicity differences between the LMC disk and halo. Theoretical models align with observed trends, where bolometric corrections amplify luminosity at longer wavelengths. Metallicity dominates TRGB luminosity variations, as age and mass loss effects are minimal in old globular clusters (10–13 Gyr). Infrared excess in metal-rich TRGBs implies circumstellar dust, further reducing their optical brightness.  

# Implication  
The near-constancy of \(M_{\mathrm{I}}\) for \([\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}] < -1.2\) validates TRGB as a robust standard candle, yielding \(H_0\) consistent with Planck CMB estimates. For metal-rich systems (\([\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}] > -1.2\)), metallicity corrections are essential to avoid overestimating \(H_0\). Infrared bands provide complementary constraints with smaller systematic uncertainties. Future studies must account for metallicity gradients and circumstellar dust in metal-rich TRGB stars to refine distance measurements. These findings underscore the necessity of metallicity-aware calibrations in resolving the Hubble tension and advancing precision cosmology.
