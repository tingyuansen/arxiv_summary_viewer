# Background  
The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) is advancing the construction of two radio interferometers in Australia (SKA-Low) and South Africa (SKA1-Mid), with first science expected by 2026. The project, which achieved First Light in January 2024, involves 130,000 low-frequency antennas (50 MHz to 350 MHz) and 200 mid-frequency antennas (350 MHz to 15.5 GHz), producing raw data rates exceeding 10 Tb/s and requiring 100 Pflop/s computing power. SKAO’s operational demands include 99.9% availability, scalability, and reproducibility. The Observatory Management and Control (OMC) system employs Agile software development, leveraging Cloud Computing, DevOps, and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to reduce operational costs and carbon emissions. The phased construction schedule, involving Array Assemblies (AAs), integrates Agile software deployment to handle increasing data processing needs. Key milestones include AA0.5 (the first test array for interferometry) and AA2 (marking the start of science verification). The SKA’s software architecture emphasizes deployability, modifiability, and testability, aligning with industry best practices for efficient project delivery.  

# Motivation  
The complexity of SKAO’s software ecosystem necessitates scalable, resilient, and maintainable solutions. Agile methodologies and cloud-native principles are critical to managing distributed development teams, ensuring rapid iteration, and meeting stringent operational requirements. Lessons from observatories like ALMA, Vera Rubin, LOFAR, and GMRT highlight the need for standardized workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and containerization to address challenges in large-scale, multinational collaborations. The transition to a cloud-native Agile framework aims to reduce costs, improve reproducibility, and support long-term sustainability while harmonizing pre-construction experiences and enabling efficient integration of hardware and software components.  

# Methodology  
The SKAO employs the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe®), orchestrating software development through Agile Array Release Trains (ARTs) such as Observation Management and Control (OMC), Data Processor (DP), Services, and Integration ARTs. A cloud-native approach underpins development, with functionalities decomposed into microservices managed via GitLab CI/CD, Jira for issue tracking, and Kubernetes for container orchestration. The SKA Minimal Viable Product Integration (SKAMPI) served as a foundational toolset for Agile delivery, integrating components like the Telescope Manager (TM) and Central Signal Processor (CSP) via automated CI/CD frameworks. The EngageSKA cluster, hosted at the Institute of Telecommunications in Aveiro, provided a cloud-based platform for testing, featuring OpenStack and Kubernetes (syscore) for scalable resource allocation. Tango Controls, a distributed middleware leveraging CORBA and ZeroMQ, was adopted for hardware and software control, while Taranta offered a graphical interface for device monitoring. Centralized configuration using Ansible and libguestfs for volume migration streamlined resource management.  

# Results  
SKAMPI validated software correctness and enabled end-to-end functionality but faced challenges due to brittleness and lack of ownership, leading to its deprecation. EngageSKA supported development with 16 rack servers, including compute, storage, and GPU nodes, facilitating SKA Data Challenges and CI/CD pipelines. Resource management issues included instances consuming up to 8 CPUs, 16GB RAM, and ~1000GB volumes without ownership. Migration efforts reduced volume sizes from ~100GB to ~3GB using libguestfs. Tango and Taranta successfully enabled real-time monitoring, alarms, and forensic analysis across SKA teams. Prometheus, Thanos, and Grafana were implemented for performance monitoring, enhancing CI/CD efficiency.  

# Interpretation  
SKAMPI’s deprecation underscored the need for robust ownership models and stable architectures in large-scale Agile projects. The EngageSKA cluster demonstrated the viability of cloud-native environments for insulating developers from hardware complexities, though resource management required centralized automation. Agile practices and standardized APIs improved portability, while lessons from ALMA and Vera Rubin informed SKAO’s transition to modular, service-oriented architectures. The adoption of green ICT trends, including containerization and DevOps, reduced operational costs and carbon footprints, aligning with sustainability goals.  

# Implication  
The ENGAGE SKA platform established a collaborative framework for cloud-native Agile development, setting a precedent for large-scale observatories. Its emphasis on CI/CD, test automation, and end-to-end integration accelerates SKAO’s transition to a Lean Enterprise, ensuring scalability and maintainability. The project’s open-source tools and reference implementations lower barriers to entry for global collaborators, fostering innovation in ICT and radio astronomy. By integrating industrial best practices with astronomical requirements, SKAO’s software ecosystem enhances long-term operational resilience and adaptability to future technological advancements.
