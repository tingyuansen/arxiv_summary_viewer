# Background  
The upcoming fifth observing run (expected in 2027) of the international gravitational wave (GW) network aims to detect more binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, particularly in the high-frequency band \(\gtrsim 10^{3} \mathrm{~Hz}\), enhancing post-merger waveform resolution. These waveforms provide insights into hypermassive neutron stars (HMNSs), which are supported by differential rotation, thermal pressure, and magnetic forces, carrying information about the nuclear equation of state (EOS) and gravitational theories. Scalar-tensor theories, such as Damour-Esposito-Farese (DEF) theory, offer alternatives to general relativity (GR), with constraints on the scalar field mass \(m_{\phi}\) from pulsar timing and GW observations. Recent studies have identified stationary, axisymmetric scalarized neutron stars (NSs) with angular momenta exceeding GR limits, resembling HMNSs from BNS mergers. These super-rotating NSs challenge stability criteria, prompting the extension of the turning-point criterion—used for secular instabilities in uniformly rotating NSs—to differentially rotating scalarized NSs.  

# Motivation  
The primary question is whether scalarized NSs with ultra-high angular momenta, potentially formed in BNS mergers, are dynamically stable. This work investigates their stability through axisymmetric numerical relativity simulations, assessing perturbations and validating the turning-point criterion for differentially rotating NSs in scalar-tensor gravity. The criterion identifies instability onset via extremal points of the gravitational mass \(M_{G}\) as a function of central energy density \(\epsilon_{c}\). The results aim to determine if scalarized NS mergers can produce ultra-highly rotating remnants, offering insights into HMNS stability and dynamics in scalar-tensor gravity.  

# Methodology  
The Jordan frame action of DEF theory is  
\[
S= \frac{1}{16 \pi} \int d^{4} x \sqrt{-g}\left[\phi \mathcal{R}-\frac{\omega(\phi)}{\phi} \nabla_{a} \phi \nabla^{a} \phi-U(\phi)\right] -S_{\text {matter }},  
\]  
with \(\omega(\phi) = B \ln \phi\) and \(U(\phi) = \frac{2 m_{\phi}^{2} \varphi^{2} \phi^{2}}{B}\). The Einstein frame simplifies the potential to \(V=m_{\phi}^{2} \bar{\varphi}^{2} /(2 B)\). A modified RNS code constructs equilibrium scalarized NS models using a KEH scheme in quasi-isotropic coordinates:  
\[
d s^{2} = -e^{\eta+\sigma} d t^{2} + e^{\eta-\sigma} r^{2} \sin ^{2} \theta\left(d \phi^{2}-\varpi d t\right)^{2} + e^{2 \tau}\left(d r^{2}+r^{2} d \theta^{2}\right).  
\]  
The 4-parameter differential rotation law,  
\[
\Omega=\Omega_{c} \frac{1+\left(\frac{F}{B^{2} \Omega_{c}}\right)^{p}}{1+\left(\frac{F}{A^{2} \Omega_{c}}\right)^{p+q}},  
\]  
governs angular momentum \(J = \int_{r<R_{\star}} \alpha \rho h F \sqrt{\gamma} d^{3} x\). Axisymmetric numerical relativity simulations employ the BSSN formalism with moving puncture gauge, cartoon method, 9 refinement levels, 6th-order finite differences, and HLLC Riemann solver. Parameters include scalar mass \(m_{\phi}\), angular momentum \(J\), and central energy density \(\epsilon_{\text{thre}}\), focusing on the MPA1 EOS.  

# Results  
For massless scalar fields, turning points were identified in sequences with \(J=8\), \(12\), and \(20\), but not \(J=40\). Stability assessments showed marginally stable models near mass maxima; \(J=40\) models remained stable. Stable models exhibited damping of density perturbations and scalar field oscillations within dynamical timescales, while unstable models collapsed into black holes with scalar field dissipation. For massive scalars (\(m_{\phi} = 0.01\)), sequences with \(J=8\) and \(12\) had turning points, while \(J=20\) and \(30\) remained stable. Unstable models collapsed into black holes, with scalar fields decaying to \(\sim 10^{-3}\). Axisymmetric oscillation spectra for \(J=8\) revealed quasi-radial \(m=0\) fundamental and \(\phi\)-modes, with \(\phi\)-mode frequencies approaching the Yukawa cutoff \(f_c = \omega_\phi / (2\pi)\) near instability onset.  

# Interpretation  
The turning-point criterion is validated for differentially rotating scalarized NSs in DEF theory, aligning with GR’s criterion for rigid rotation. Instability arises near turning points in constant-\(J\) sequences. For massless scalars, instability occurs when the \(\phi\)-mode reaches the Yukawa cutoff frequency, contrasting GR’s fundamental mode mechanism. Stable models preserve density, scalar profiles, and rotation laws over \(\gtrsim 15\) ms. Axisymmetric results exclude non-axisymmetric instabilities (e.g., bar-mode), necessitating 3D simulations to assess broader stability.  

# Implication  
These findings provide insights into the dynamics of HMNS remnants in scalar-tensor gravity, particularly the stability of ultra-highly rotating scalarized NSs. The results highlight the role of scalar fields in altering instability mechanisms and emphasize the need for 3D simulations to explore non-axisymmetric instabilities. Validating the turning-point criterion in scalar-tensor gravity enhances the framework for interpreting GW signals from BNS mergers.
