# Background  
The \(\Lambda\)CDM model, despite its success, faces tensions such as the \(\sim 5 \sigma\) Hubble tension and \(\sim 3 \sigma S_{8}\) tension, hinting at possible new physics. The DESI collaboration’s recent findings, combined with DESY5 data, have reignited debates on dynamical dark energy (DE). While DESI baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and DESY5 alone align with \(\Lambda\)CDM, their joint analysis with Planck CMB suggests a \(3.9 \sigma\) preference for dynamical DE. The Carnegie Supernova Project, CfA surveys, and Foundation Supernova Survey enhance Type Ia supernova (SN) datasets for precision cosmology. Studies explore late-time or local-scale new physics to resolve the Hubble tension, alongside models like non-minimally coupled gravity and inhomogeneous interacting DE.  

# Motivation  
This study aims to determine whether the DESI collaboration’s reported preference for dynamical DE stems from new physics or systematics, particularly in the low-redshift SN (low-\(z\) SN) sample within DESY5. Inconsistencies between DES measurements and previous datasets (e.g., SDSS BAO, PantheonPlus) raise concerns about potential calibration errors or sample selection biases in low-\(z\) SNe. Resolving this is critical to validate claims of dynamical DE.  

# Methodology  
The analysis combines DESI BAO, DESY5, SDSS eBOSS BAO, PantheonPlus, and Planck CMB data. Standardized apparent magnitudes \(m_{B}^{\text{corr}}\) are used to detect systematics in the low-\(z\) SN sample. A likelihood function based on distance moduli residuals is defined, and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) constraints are applied to the \(w_{0}w_{a}\)CDM model. Magnitude-redshift relations for low-\(z\) and DES-SN samples are reconstructed, focusing on the intercept \(-5a_{B}\), a systematic-sensitive parameter expected to remain stable within a single SN compilation.  

# Results  
A \(\sim 0.043\) magnitude discrepancy in \(-5a_{B}\) is identified between low-\(z\) and DES-SN samples, unrelated to \(\Omega_{m}\) values and ruling out local-scale effects. This inconsistency arises abruptly around \(z \sim 0.1\). Excluding the low-\(z\) sample reduces the preference for dynamical DE from \(\sim 3.9 \sigma\) to \(<2 \sigma\). DESI BAO measurements alone deviate from Planck-\(\Lambda\)CDM predictions, particularly in the LRG2 sample (\(0.6 < z < 0.8\)), hinting at dynamical DE or modified gravity. Correcting the \(-5a_{B}\) discrepancy via magnitude adjustments or sample exclusion similarly reduces the significance to \(\sim 1.6 \sigma\).  

# Interpretation  
The \(\sim 0.043\) magnitude discrepancy in \(-5a_{B}\) indicates systematics in the multi-sample mixed low-\(z\) SNE, likely due to calibration errors or incorrect sample selection. DES-SN exhibits stable \(a_{B}\) distributions aligned with Planck-\(\Lambda\)CDM, while low-\(z\) SNe show irregular fluctuations. These systematics artificially amplify the preference for dynamical DE. DESI BAO deviations in the LRG2 sample remain intriguing but inconclusive, as current data cannot distinguish between dynamical DE and modified gravity.  

# Implication  
The DESI result is likely a mirage caused by low-\(z\) SN systematics rather than new physics. Correcting these systematics aligns observations with \(\Lambda\)CDM, reducing the dynamical DE preference to \(<2 \sigma\). This underscores the need for rigorous scrutiny of SN calibration and sample homogeneity in future surveys. While DESI BAO deviations warrant further investigation, current evidence does not decisively challenge the standard cosmological model. Addressing SN systematics will be pivotal for resolving cosmological tensions and validating DE evolution claims.
