# Background  
Compton-thick active galactic nuclei (CT-AGNs), with column densities \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{H}} \geqslant 1.5 \times 10^{24} \mathrm{~cm}^{-2}\), are heavily obscured and emit weak X-ray radiation, making them challenging to detect. Despite their faintness, CT-AGNs are significant contributors to the cosmic X-ray background (CXB), with models suggesting they constitute \(30\%\) or more of the AGN population. However, observed fractions, such as in the COSMOS survey, are much lower, indicating many CT-AGNs remain hidden, particularly in AGNs with low X-ray photon counts.  

# Motivation  
This work aims to identify these obscured CT-AGNs by analyzing multiwavelength data from a sample of 440 AGNs in the COSMOS survey. The motivation stems from the discrepancy between theoretical predictions of CT-AGN abundance and their observed underrepresentation, highlighting the need for improved detection methods to uncover the missing population and refine AGN demographic models.  

# Methodology  
The study utilized multiwavelength data from the COSMOS survey, including X-ray observations from Chandra and XMM-Newton, UV-FIR photometry from COSMOS2020 and COSMOS2015 catalogs, and optical-NIR spectra from Hasinger et al. (2018). A sample of 440 AGNs was selected based on extragalactic origin, reliable optical counterparts, low X-ray counts (<30 in \(0.5-7 \mathrm{keV}\)), and multiwavelength coverage. Redshifts were prioritized from spectroscopic sources, with photometric redshifts used otherwise, and X-ray luminosities corrected using \(\frac{L_{\text{new}}}{L_{\text{old}}} = \frac{R(z_{\text{new}})^{2}(1+z_{\text{new}})^{\Gamma-2}}{R(z_{\text{old}})^{2}(1+z_{\text{old}})^{\Gamma-2}}\) (\(\Gamma = 1.4\)). SED fitting with CIGALE derived AGN and host galaxy properties, including rest-frame \(6 \mu \mathrm{m}\) luminosities, stellar masses (\(\mathrm{M}_{\star}\)), and star formation rates (\(\mathrm{SFR} = 1.09 \times 10^{-9}(3.3 \mathrm{~L}_{\mathrm{UV}} + \mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{IR}})\)). Optical-NIR spectral decomposition using PyQSOFit extracted emission line luminosities. CT-AGN diagnostics compared observed \(2-10 \mathrm{keV}\) luminosities to \(6 \mu \mathrm{m}\) (MIR) and high-ionization emission lines ([O III] \(\lambda 5007\), [Ne V] \(\lambda 3426\)), with [O III] estimated from [O II] \(\lambda 3727\) for \(z > 1\) sources. Bayesian information criterion (BIC) assessed AGN component reliability in SEDs. X-ray spectral modeling incorporated absorption, reflection, and scattering components via \(\text{phabs} * \text{powerlaw} + \text{constant} * \text{powerlaw} + \text{pexmon}\).  

# Results  
From 440 AGNs, 18 CT-AGNs were identified: 3 via MIR diagnostics, 16 via emission lines ([O III], [Ne V]), and one overlapping source. Four AGNs showed discrepancies between MIR and emission line classifications, potentially due to variability or [O III] overestimation from [O II]. The CT-AGN fraction (4.1%) remained below theoretical predictions. Host galaxy properties (\(\mathrm{M}_{\star}\), SFR) showed no significant differences between CT-AGNs and non-CT-AGNs, supported by Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.  

# Interpretation  
Diagnostic discrepancies for four AGNs may arise from temporal variability or [O III] luminosity estimation uncertainties. The low CT-AGN fraction suggests selection biases, such as reliance on high-ionization lines and SED fitting limitations. Underestimation of [O III] luminosities due to assumed [O II]/[O III] ratios (0.1–0.6) might miss CT-AGNs. The absence of host galaxy differences challenges models linking CT-AGNs to distinct environments, possibly reflecting high-redshift AGN diversity.  

# Implication  
This study underscores the necessity of multiwavelength approaches to detect obscured CT-AGNs and reconcile observed fractions with CXB models. The lack of host galaxy property differences questions evolutionary scenarios associating CT-AGNs with specific galactic conditions. Future efforts must address identification biases and incorporate advanced spectroscopic techniques to uncover the missing CT-AGN population.
