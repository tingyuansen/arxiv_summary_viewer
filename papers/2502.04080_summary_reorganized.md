# Background  
Tidal disruption events (TDEs), caused by stars being shredded by supermassive black holes (SMBHs), produce luminous transients with debated emission mechanisms. AT 2018dyk, initially classified as a TDE, was later debated as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) turn-on event. Recent analyses, including follow-up spectra and host-galaxy data, support its classification as a TDE occurring in a gas-rich environment, evidenced by mid-infrared (MIR) outbursts and Fe coronal lines. Comparisons with TDE-linked extreme coronal line emitters (TDE-ECLEs) and other TDEs reveal shared characteristics, including a MIR color-luminosity relationship in gas-rich environments. AT 2018dyk’s evolution aligns with TDE-ECLEs, exhibiting rapid spectral changes, strong Fe coronal lines, and MIR outbursts. A Hubble constant \(H_0 = 73 \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}\) is assumed.  

# Motivation  
The classification of AT 2018dyk as a TDE or AGN remains unresolved, necessitating multi-wavelength follow-up observations to distinguish its nature. Understanding its emission mechanisms and environmental context is critical for clarifying the connection between TDEs, TDE-ECLEs, and AGN variability, particularly in gas-rich environments where dust reprocessing and coronal line emission play significant roles.  

# Methodology  
Optical spectroscopy from DESI (2023), SDSS Legacy (2002), MaNGA (2017), Keck/LRIS, and FLOYDS (2018) was combined with photometry from ATLAS and ZTF. MIR data from AllWISE and NEOWISE-R were analyzed to study the transient’s behavior. Host galaxy properties, including stellar mass (\(11.02 \pm 0.02 \log_{10}(M_{\odot} \text{yr}^{-1})\)), Sérsic index (\(n = 2.20 \pm 0.01\)), and specific star-formation rate (\(-10.97 \pm 0.13 \log_{10}(\mathrm{yr}^{-1})\)), were derived. Emission line fitting, MIR variability analysis, and comparisons with coronal-line TDEs (CrL-TDEs), TDE-ECLEs, and AGN-ECLEs were performed. Power-law fits to MIR light curves and virial distance estimates from Fe coronal line FWHM velocities (640–1370 km s\(^{-1}\)) were conducted.  

# Results  
AT 2018dyk exhibited broad H, He, and Fe coronal lines post-outburst, with Fe lines emerging 19 days post-peak and persisting for 35–1819 days. MIR photometry revealed a delayed peak (~180 days) and color evolution (\(\Delta W1 = 0.40 \pm 0.01\) mag, \(\Delta W2 = 0.79 \pm 0.01\) mag, \(\Delta(W1-W2) = 0.39 \pm 0.01\) mag). The host galaxy, SDSS J1533+4432, showed LINER emission from evolved stars, a central stellar velocity dispersion of \(122.5 \pm 1.9 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\), and an SMBH mass of \(6.86 \pm 0.05 \log_{10}(\mathrm{M}_{\odot})\). DESI spectra >5 years post-peak indicated a return to pre-outburst states, but [O III] \(\lambda5007\) emission strengthened significantly. MIR power-law decline indices (\(-1.25 \pm 0.04\) in \(W1\), \(-1.02 \pm 0.03\) in \(W2\)) aligned with SMBH accretion models.  

# Interpretation  
AT 2018dyk’s rapid spectral evolution, MIR outbursts, and Fe coronal lines support its classification as a TDE in a gas-rich environment. Layered gas structures near the SMBH, evidenced by coronal line widths and virial distances (0.02–0.97 pc), suggest X-ray reprocessing. The host’s "retired galaxy" classification and lack of AGN activity reinforce the TDE scenario. MIR color-luminosity trends and variability distinguish it from AGN-ECLEs, with dust reprocessing explaining flux excesses. The transient’s shorter MIR outburst duration and smaller amplitude compared to TDE-ECLEs imply lower gas density or covering factors near the SMBH.  

# Implication  
AT 2018dyk reinforces the TDE-ECLE connection and highlights the role of MIR observations in classifying transients. The absence of recurrent flares and distinct MIR evolution from AGNs underscore the importance of long-term, multi-wavelength follow-up. The end of NEOWISE-R creates a gap in studying such systems, emphasizing the need for future MIR surveys. These findings advance understanding of TDEs in diverse environments and their interplay with SMBH accretion processes.
