# Background  
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), such as Quasar 3C 273 (\(z=0.158\)), exhibit high variability across electromagnetic wavelengths. Emissions from 3C 273 involve synchrotron radiation and thermal processes: synchrotron flares dominate from radio to IR/optical bands, UV radiation may arise from clumping matter or an accretion disc, and X-rays are produced via Comptonization or inverse Compton processes. The Integral Science Data Centre (ISDC) database provides extensive multiwavelength data, enabling detailed variability studies of such systems.  

# Motivation  
Non-extensive statistical mechanics offers a framework to analyze the entropic behavior of quasars, a gap this study addresses by examining 3C 273's nonextensivity across wavelengths. The work aims to link Tsallis entropy (\(S_{q}\)) and \(q\)-indices to physical processes in AGNs, leveraging the ISDC's multiwavelength light curves to explore variability and energy-dependent entropy trends.  

# Methodology  
The study analyzes 39 light curves of 3C 273 from 1963 to 2005, covering radio (5–37 GHz), millimeter/submillimeter (0.8–3.3 mm), IR (1.25–3.6 \(\mu\)m), optical (3439–7000 Å), UV (1300–3000 Å), and X-ray (5–200 keV) bands. Data quality was ensured by including only flags 0 or +1. The Tsallis entropy framework, a generalization of Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) entropy, was employed to study nonextensive systems. Tsallis entropy is defined as \(S_{q} = k_{B} \frac{1-\sum_{i} P_{i}^{q}}{q-1}\), where \(q=1\) recovers BG entropy. The \(q\)-Gaussian distribution, \(P_{q}(y) = A_{q}[1+(q-1)(y/\sigma_{q})^{2}]^{1/(1-q)}\), models flux variations, with \(y = (x - \langle x \rangle)/\sigma\) normalizing the data. Parameters \(A_{q}\) and \(\sigma_{q}\) depend on \(q\), derived via gamma functions and generalized standard deviations.  

# Results  
All 39 light curves follow Tsallis distributions, with \(q>1\) indicating longer-tailed profiles. For example, the 8 GHz radio light curve fits a \(q\)-Gaussian with \(q=1.60\) (\(R^{2}=0.997\)), whereas Gaussian fits fail to capture fluxes above \(1\sigma\). Two entropy jumps occur in the IR (0.34 eV) and X-ray bands. The IR peak correlates with synchrotron flares and dust thermal radiation, while the X-ray peak is less robust due to data limitations. The entropy-energy relationship is modeled as \(S_{q}=A+B \exp(-E/E_{0})\), with parameters \(A=2.10 \pm 0.92\), \(B=0.01 \pm 0.023\), \(E_{0}=0.65 \pm 0.46\) eV (radio to submillimeter) and \(A=1.91 \pm 2.11\), \(B=9.04 \pm 2.43\), \(E_{0}=0.64 \pm 0.18\) eV (IR to X-ray), yielding correlation coefficients of 0.51 and 0.75. Entropy \(S_{q}\) for hard X-rays and \(\gamma\)-rays could not be calculated due to insufficient data.  

# Interpretation  
The IR entropy jump at 0.34 eV is attributed to synchrotron flares and thermal radiation from hot dust, while the X-ray increase may stem from Comptonization processes. Millimeter-band variability aligns with entropy trends, reflecting synchrotron-dominated flaring. The optical-to-UV range shows weak entropy dispersion, contrasting with rising fractional variability (\(F_{\text{var}}\)) at shorter wavelengths. The X-ray entropy uncertainty arises from poor data quality, complicating distinctions between radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars. Tsallis distributions effectively describe variability except in the IR band, where Gaussian profiles dominate.  

# Implication  
This study demonstrates the utility of non-extensive statistical mechanics in analyzing AGN variability. The entropy-energy jumps highlight complex interactions between synchrotron processes, thermal radiation, and flaring activity. The IR peak’s physical significance contrasts with the X-ray peak’s statistical uncertainty, underscoring the need for improved X-ray data. Future work with robust datasets and advanced statistical methods could validate these findings and extend the framework to other astrophysical sources.
