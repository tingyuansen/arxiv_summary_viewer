# Background  
The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detectors have observed nearly 300 gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers, revealing substructure in mass distributions, small spin magnitudes, and evolving merger rates with redshift. Spin orientations are key discriminators of formation channels: field binaries are expected to have aligned spins, while dynamically formed systems exhibit random orientations. Recent studies using LVK data rule out anti-aligned spins but suggest isotropy, with tentative evidence for excess spin tilts around \(\cos \theta \sim 0.3\). The effective aligned spin, \(\chi_{\text{eff}}\), favors positive values, indicating a field binary contribution. Spin-orbit resonances (SORs), influenced by post-Newtonian (PN) dynamics and mass transfer, cause spin azimuth angles \(\phi_{12}\) to librate around \(0\) or \(\pm \pi\), distinguishing standard and reversed mass ratio scenarios.  

# Motivation  
This work introduces an astrophysically motivated model to constrain mass ratio reversal fractions, leveraging \(\phi_{12}\) inference and full parameter estimation to distinguish SORs. The goal is to probe formation channels (e.g., isolated binaries vs. dynamical capture) by identifying substructure in \(\phi_{12}\) distributions, potentially detectable by the end of LIGO's fourth observing run (O4).  

# Methodology  
Four BBH populations (200 events each) are simulated: strong resonances (aligned spins), mixed isotropic-resonant, fully isotropic, and weak resonances. Masses follow a Power-Law + Peak distribution, spins a Beta distribution, and redshifts a power-law up to \(z=1.9\). Spin tilts (\(\theta_{1,2}\)) and azimuths (\(\phi_{12}\)) are modeled using a mixture of isotropic and aligned components, with 30% undergoing mass ratio reversal (RMR). Bayesian parameter estimation is performed using BiLBY and the Dynesty nested sampler, with uniform priors for binary parameters and a comoving volume prior for luminosity distance. Waveform models (NRSur7dq4 for high masses, IMRPhenomXPHM for lower masses) are applied, and spin parameters are evolved to ISCO frequency post-inference. Hierarchical Bayesian inference using GWPopulation constrains hyper-parameters governing \(\phi_{12}\) distributions, incorporating von Mises models to test mixture fractions and peak locations. Selection biases are mitigated via Monte Carlo integrals over sensitivity injections.  

# Results  
For the strong resonances population, hyper-parameters for \(\cos \theta_{1}, \cos \theta_{2}, \phi_{12}\) are recovered within \(3\sigma\), with \(\phi_{12}\) driving constraints on \(f_{\text{RMR}}\) (posterior width \(\lesssim 0.7\)). The mixed population (strong SORs + isotropic) recovers true hyper-parameters within \(3\sigma\), with \(\phi_{12}\) providing additional information on mixture fractions. Fully isotropic populations show no spurious SOR evidence, with \(\phi_{12}\) distributions consistent with isotropy. Weak resonances align better with GWTC-3 data, showing no narrow aligned components but recovering true \(\phi_{12}\) distributions at high credibility. GWTC-3 analysis reveals no strong SOR evidence but hints at \(\phi_{12} = \pm \pi\) excesses. Spin tilt distributions are roughly flat, with mixture fractions (\(\xi\)) constrained to \(\lesssim 0.3\) at \(95\%\) credibility.  

# Interpretation  
The \(\phi_{12}\) distribution is the primary discriminator of SORs, with excesses at \(0, \pm \pi\) indicative of mass ratio reversal scenarios. Hierarchical inference recovers true hyper-parameters for simulated populations but faces challenges in astrophysical interpretation due to model-dependent \(\xi\) posteriors and prior degeneracies. While O4 data may not definitively confirm SORs, they can distinguish weak resonances from tidal effects. GWTC-3 results caution against overinterpreting phenomenological hyper-parameters, as they weakly proxy astrophysical fractions.  

# Implication  
This study demonstrates the feasibility of probing SORs via hierarchical analysis of BBH populations, offering insights into formation channels and dynamics. The \(\phi_{12}\) distributionâ€™s sensitivity to mass ratio reversal fractions highlights its utility in distinguishing isolated binaries from dynamical captures. However, current methods require larger catalogs and improved models to mitigate biases in spin magnitude recovery and prior-driven uncertainties. Future work should refine tilt models and explore density estimators for robust inference.
