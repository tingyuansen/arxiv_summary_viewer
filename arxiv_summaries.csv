2502.03778,Self-Supervised Learning for Solar Radio Spectrum Classification,Siqi Li et al.,"Solar radio bursts offer crucial insights into solar activity and play a significant role in understanding solar outbursts, which are key to both solar physics research and space weather forecasting. Observations from instruments such as the solar broadband radio spectrometers at the National Astronomical Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have generated large quantities of data. However, the inherent scarcity and noise in solar radio burst events, along with extremely imbalanced classes when compared to calibration and non-burst signals, challenge conventional analysis. Traditional deep learning methods like convolutional neural networks, recurrent models, and ResNets have been applied to these images, yet they struggle with the limited amount of labeled data and the disparity between natural images and solar radio spectrum images.","The need to overcome the challenges posed by limited labeled solar data and the intrinsic differences between natural images and solar spectra motivates the adoption of self-supervised learning methods. Conventional transfer learning, often borrowed from natural image classification tasks, does not adequately address the distinct characteristics of solar radio bursts because of the substantial redundancy present in the images. This discrepancy, combined with the ever-increasing data volume and the demands for real-time automated detection of rare events, has led researchers to explore techniques inspired by natural language processing—such as self-masking—to automatically learn essential features from the image itself, reducing the reliance on extensive labeled datasets.","The proposed approach leverages self-supervised learning by adapting techniques originally developed for natural language processing, such as BERT and GPT, to the domain of solar radio spectrum classification. The method begins with careful data preprocessing, where raw binary data from the solar broadband radio spectrometers is converted into images with frequency represented on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis. To enhance the clarity of the burst features and reduce transverse stripe noise, frequency channel normalization is applied using the formula  
\[
p^{\prime}(x, y)=p(x, y)-\frac{1}{n} \sum_{y=0}^{n} p(x, y)+\frac{1}{m n} \sum_{x=0}^{m} \sum_{y=0}^{n} p(x, y)
\]
where \(p(x, y)\) represents the original radio intensity and \(p^{\prime}(x, y)\) is the normalized intensity. In the core of the methodology, solar radio spectrum images are partitioned into blocks and a subset of them is randomly masked. This self-masking technique forces the model, implemented with a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, to learn and predict the masked portions by processing only the unmasked blocks with an encoder while a complementary lightweight decoder reconstructs the image using both encoded tokens and additional mask tokens. The encoder’s efficiency is further enhanced by significantly reducing computational overhead. Additionally, the methodology integrates mixup data augmentation—where training samples are created by linear interpolations of images with their corresponding labels—and regularization techniques such as dropout variants (Dropout, DropPath, and DropAttention) to prevent overfitting. The experimental configuration involved pre-training the model on a large dataset (pre-training for 300 epochs with a batch size of 16 and a learning rate of \(1.5 \times 10^{-4}\)), followed by fine-tuning for 50 epochs with a learning rate of \(10^{-3}\).","Experiments revealed that the self-supervised approach, particularly when using a high masking rate of 60%–75%, significantly improved classification accuracy. Contrary to the 15% masking rate optimal in natural language tasks, a 75% masking rate was found to be ideal for solar images owing to their redundant information. When transfer learning was employed—pre-training the mask model on ImageNet before fine-tuning on solar spectra—the accuracy notably increased from 70.60% to 98.63%. Further improvements were observed through data enhancement techniques; combining mixup with cutmix and appropriate regularization methods increased accuracy to 99.3%, and the best performance with dropout techniques reported an accuracy of 99.5% alongside robust precision, recall, and F1 metrics. Comparisons with state-of-the-art architectures such as VGG, Swin Transformer, ResNet, MobileNet, GoogLeNet, and DenseNet confirmed the superiority of the self-supervised learning model with the Vision Transformer backbone.","The experimental results demonstrate that self-supervised learning, and particularly the self-masking approach, can extract highly informative image features even from limited solar radio spectrum data. By removing irrelevant information through high masking, the method capitalizes on the natural redundancy within the images to improve feature learning and transferability. The success of pre-training on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet, coupled with fine-tuning on specialized solar data, underscores the potential of using self-supervised methods to bridge the gap between data scarcity and the complexity of solar phenomena. The performance gains observed also highlight the robustness and effectiveness of the Vision Transformer when combined with innovative data augmentation and dropout strategies.","The promising results of this study imply that self-supervised learning techniques can markedly enhance the classification accuracy of solar radio spectra, leading to more reliable and automated detection systems in solar physics and space weather forecasting. The methodology not only addresses the challenges of data imbalance and noise but also offers a scalable approach for future research, including finer classification of various solar radio burst types. Although the model’s large parameter count and extended training durations present challenges, ongoing research aimed at optimization could pave the way for real-time analysis and improved understanding of solar physical phenomena, ultimately contributing to more accurate space weather warnings and a deeper insight into solar activity."
2502.04091,Asymmetry at Low Surface Brightness as an Indicator of Environmental Processes in the Fornax Cluster,X. Xu et al.,"The Fornax Cluster, recognized as the second most massive cluster within 20 Mpc, provides a unique laboratory for studying galaxy evolution in environments characterized by a dense core and strong tidal fields. Underpinned by the \(\Lambda\)CDM model, the hierarchical formation of cosmic structures sets the stage for understanding how larger galaxies develop via mergers and accretion of smaller systems. In this broader cosmological context, dwarf galaxies, forming slowly in low-mass halos and being particularly sensitive to environmental effects, become key to testing the morphology-density relation established in earlier studies. Deep observational surveys such as the Fornax Deep Survey (FDS) have rendered high-quality multiband data, allowing astronomers to quantify morphological features and to scrutinize environmental processes such as ram-pressure stripping, tidal distortions, and harassment within galaxy clusters.","The study is driven by the need to elucidate the role of the cluster environment in sculpting the morphological characteristics of dwarf galaxies. As dwarfs are highly susceptible to external influences, understanding how processes like tidal forces in the cluster core or ram pressure in the outskirts contribute to their asymmetry and smoothness becomes critical. This work specifically aims to determine if asymmetry at low surface brightness can serve as a reliable indicator of these environmental influences, thereby offering insights into the transitional phase of dwarf galaxies as they evolve toward quiescence.","Morphological analysis in this study relies on the non-parametric CAS system, focusing particularly on asymmetry (A) and smoothness (S) parameters while excluding concentration due to its insensitivity to irregular light distributions. Asymmetry is quantified by rotating each galaxy by \(180^{\circ}\) and subtracting the rotated image from the original, using the relation  
\[
A = \frac{\sum\left(I_{0}-I_{\theta}\right)}{2 \sum\left|I_{0}\right|} - A_{\text{bgr}},
\]
where \(I_{0}\) is the original image, \(I_{\theta}\) is the rotated image, and \(A_{\text{bgr}}\) accounts for background asymmetry. Smoothness is measured by comparing the original image with a smoothed version, defined as  
\[
S = 10 \times \sum_{x, y=1}^{N} \frac{\left(I_{x, y} - I_{x, y}^{\sigma}\right) - B_{x, y}}{I_{x, y}},
\]
where \(I_{x, y}^{\sigma}\) is the smoothed image and \(B_{x, y}\) represents the corresponding smoothed background. The analysis used data from the FDS, which offers deep multiband imaging (\(u, g, r, i\)) across a large area centered on the cluster, ensuring robust measurement of structural properties via automated detection and photometric characterization. Special attention is paid to asymmetry profiles computed in elliptical annuli, with corrections for residual gradients through masking and background subtraction using a planar model, \(z = C_{1}(x - x_{0}) + C_{2}(y - y_{0}) + C_{0}\).","Analysis of 556 dwarf galaxies in the Fornax Cluster reveals that asymmetry varies with galactocentric distance, peaking in both the outer regions (\(R > 1 \text{ Mpc}\)) and very central regions (\(R \leq 0.12 \text{ Mpc}\)). The outer regions display elevated asymmetry levels likely linked to ongoing star formation and less environmental quenching, as evidenced by bluer colors, whereas the enhanced inner asymmetry appears to be driven by tidal interactions in the cluster core. Additionally, fainter galaxies tend to exhibit higher asymmetry, suggesting that low stellar mass systems are more vulnerable to environmental influences. The smoothness parameter shows an inverse relationship with stellar mass, indicating that fainter dwarfs have featureless outskirts. Complementary analysis using projected phase-space diagrams corroborates these trends, with galaxies near the pericentre displaying the most significant asymmetry, implying that disturbances are especially pronounced during first pericentric passages. Simulations utilizing \(r\)-band FDS data further highlight a detection bias for dwarf galaxies within 10 kpc of NGC 1399, with detection ratios analyzed as functions of distance and stellar mass, though these biases do not significantly affect the overall conclusions.","The findings suggest distinct environmental mechanisms acting on dwarf galaxies depending on their position within the cluster. In the periphery, higher asymmetry is attributed to ongoing star formation and interactions with the intracluster medium, while in the core, tidal forces seem to artificially enhance asymmetry, challenging conventional expectations based on \(\Lambda\)CDM predictions and invoking potential consideration of alternative gravitational models such as MOND. The phase-space analysis supports the idea that the dynamical history, particularly first pericentric passages, plays a crucial role in shaping morphological disturbances. Moreover, the correlation of asymmetry with bluer colors reinforces the interpretation that recent or ongoing star formation is a key contributor to observed morphologies.","These results underscore the significant influence of the cluster environment on the evolution of dwarf galaxy morphology. By establishing asymmetry at low surface brightness as a sensitive diagnostic of environmental processes, the study not only enhances our understanding of galaxy evolution in clusters but also sets the stage for future investigations across different clusters, aided by upcoming high-resolution surveys such as those planned with Euclid. The evidence that both outer and inner regions of the Fornax Cluster experience distinct but complementary environmental effects provides a compelling case for revisiting galaxy evolution models, potentially necessitating adjustments to incorporate transient and localized tidal phenomena."
2502.03684,Iron‐corrected Single‐epoch Black Hole Masses of DESI Quasars at low redshift,Zhiwei Pan et al.,"Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) power quasars, and their mass measurements are crucial for understanding the growth and evolution of these extraordinary objects. Traditionally, SMBH masses have been estimated from single-epoch spectra using broad emission lines such as \(\mathrm{H}\beta\) and Mg II under the assumption of virialized broad line regions and employing the \(R-L\) relation, where \(R\) is the size of the broad line region and \(L\) is the continuum luminosity. However, it is increasingly evident that factors like the accretion state and the strength of iron emission, which significantly influences the scatter in the \(R-L\) relation, must be accounted for to improve the accuracy of these measurements. In this context, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) provides an unprecedented opportunity to study over 55,000 type 1 quasars at low redshift (\(0.25 < z < 0.8\)), offering high-quality spectra that allow for detailed investigation of systematic effects on SMBH mass estimations.","The study is driven by the realization that canonical single-epoch SMBH mass estimators, which do not account for iron emission, tend to systematically overestimate black hole masses. Iron emission strength has emerged as a reliable tracer of the Eddington ratio, and incorporating an iron correction into the \(R-L\) relation is essential to refine these measurements. In particular, the goal is to recalibrate the \(\mathrm{H}\beta\)-based mass estimates and extend this correction to Mg II-based masses in order to address discrepancies in early SMBH growth history. This effort is critical to alleviating tensions in the formation models of SMBHs, especially for super-Eddington quasars and high-redshift sources where overestimation could be as significant as a factor of 2.3.","The analysis utilizes a sample drawn from the DESI survey, which employs the 4 m Mayall telescope and its 5,000-fiber spectrograph to cover approximately 14,000 square degrees. The study carefully selects 55,192 quasars with \(0.25<z<0.8\), \(r<20.5\) mag, and a high signal-to-noise ratio (\(\mathrm{TSNR}_{\mathrm{QSO}}>25\)), ensuring that the spectra are corrected for Galactic extinction and transformed to the rest frame. A comprehensive, multi-component spectral fitting is performed with DASpec, modeling the optical region from 3750 to 5500 Å with components that include a power-law continuum, an Fe II pseudo-continuum, broad and narrow \(\mathrm{H}\beta\), [O III] emission lines, and broad He II. Similarly, the UV region (2200–4260 Å) is fitted to obtain measurements for Mg II and ancillary features such as the Balmer continuum and high-order Balmer lines. The analysis distinguishes between narrow and broad components by a threshold of \(1200\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}\), and the iron template is convolved with a Gaussian to refine the fit. An iron-corrected \(R-L\) relation for \(\mathrm{H}\beta\) is applied, taking the form  
\[
\log\left(\frac{R_{\mathrm{H}\beta}}{\mathrm{ltd}}\right) = 1.65 + 0.45 \log l_{44} - 0.35 R_{\mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{H}\beta},
\]
where \(R_{\mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{H}\beta}\) is the relative iron strength. Following this, Mg II-based masses are calibrated against the iron-corrected \(\mathrm{H}\beta\) masses, with an adjusted \(R-L\) relation that incorporates an additional term \(-0.34 R_{\mathrm{Fe}}\). This methodology, including rigorous error analysis and cross-calibration between different emission lines, ensures that systematic uncertainties—estimated to be around 0.4–0.5 dex—are minimized, thus enhancing the reliability of the mass estimates across both low and high redshift regimes.","The application of an iron-corrected \(R-L\) relation yields significant differences compared to canonical mass estimates. For over 10,000 quasars with robust \(\mathrm{H}\beta\) spectral fits, the approach demonstrates that traditional measurements overestimate SMBH masses by an average factor of 1.5 and up to a factor of 5 for super-Eddington quasars. The analysis reveals that after applying the iron correction, the fraction of super-Eddington quasars increases to approximately 5% from the previously derived 0.4%. In the \(\mathrm{H}\beta\) sample, key parameters such as \(\mathrm{FWHM}_{\mathrm{H}\beta}\), \(\mathrm{EW}_{\mathrm{H}\beta}\), \(R_{\mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{H}\beta}\), and \(\mathrm{EW}_{[\mathrm{O\,III}]}\) were robustly determined, and the corrected masses showed a reduction by up to 0.7 dex. A subset of around 2,335 quasars in the Mg II sample was used to calibrate the Mg II-based estimator via a combined \(\mathrm{H}\beta\)–Mg II analysis. Here, the slope of the correlation between \(\mathrm{FWHM}_{\mathrm{Mg}\,\text{II}}\) and \(\mathrm{FWHM}_{\mathrm{H}\beta}\) is approximately 0.83, and the new iron-corrected relation for Mg II is expressed as  
\[
\log\left(\frac{R_{\mathrm{Mg\,II}}}{\mathrm{ltd}}\right) \sim 0.46 \log l_{44} - 0.34 R_{\mathrm{Fe}}.
\]
For a much larger sample of about 0.5 million DESI quasars in the redshift range \(0.6 < z < 1.6\), the application of this new estimator suggests that the current mass measurements for high-redshift (\(z \geq 6\)) quasars may be overestimated by a factor of 2.3. Detailed comparisons with previous estimators reveal systematic offsets of around 0.2 dex in some cases and highlight the importance of including iron corrections to reduce these discrepancies.","The study interprets the systematic discrepancy between canonical and iron-corrected mass estimates as strong evidence that iron emission strength is a robust tracer of the Eddington ratio. The positive correlation observed between the Eddington ratio and \(R_{\mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{H}\beta}\) reaffirms that incorporating iron strength into the \(R-L\) relation is essential for achieving accurate SMBH mass measurements. Moreover, the consistent trends such as the anti-correlation between \(R_{\mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{H}\beta}\) and both \(\mathrm{FWHM}_{\mathrm{H}\beta}\) and \(\mathrm{EW}_{[\mathrm{O\,III}]}\) align with the Eigenvector 1 paradigm observed in AGN studies. The fact that the median correction is approximately 0.16 dex (a factor of 1.5) and that super-Eddington objects are more prevalent than previously thought underscores the need to re-examine SMBH growth histories, particularly when accounting for the differences between the profiles of Fe II-related emission and the broader \(\mathrm{H}\beta\) line. The refinement in the Mg II-based mass estimator through cross-calibration further confirms the importance of accurately modeling iron emission when interpreting the fundamental properties of SMBHs.","The implications of these findings are significant for our understanding of black hole growth, especially in the early universe. Correcting for iron emission reduces the estimated SMBH masses by as much as 0.7 dex in some cases and suggests that high-redshift quasars may not be as massive as previously thought—potentially overestimated by a factor of 2.3. This reduction in mass estimates helps to alleviate existing tensions in models of early SMBH growth and massive seed formation scenarios, supporting a scenario in which rapid accretion and high Eddington ratios play a critical role. Additionally, the study emphasizes that future reverberation mapping and interferometric studies, as well as observations with the JWST, will be crucial in validating the iron-corrected \(R-L\) relations and refining our understanding of SMBH evolution across cosmic time."
2502.04246,Multi-fidelity emulator for large-scale 21 cm lightcone images: a few-shot transfer learning approach with generative adversarial network,Kangning Diao et al.,"The study is set against the backdrop of upcoming large-scale surveys that aim to generate mock data for studying the epoch of reionization (EoR) using 21 cm lightcone images. Traditional numerical simulations of these phenomena, especially when scaled to hundreds of megaparsecs, become prohibitively expensive. In response, machine learning emulators, particularly those based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), have emerged as a computationally efficient alternative. By harnessing techniques from GANs, researchers can emulate complex astrophysical images with high fidelity, thereby offering novel ways to reproduce both brightness temperature fields and underlying cosmic web structures present during reionization.","The principal motivation for this work lies in overcoming the enormous computational cost typically associated with high-fidelity large-scale simulations. While small-scale simulations can be performed efficiently, extending these to large-scale images demands exponentially more resources. The study addresses this challenge by introducing a few-shot transfer learning strategy that leverages abundant small-scale training data to enable accurate emulation on large scales. In doing so, the approach not only maintains the detailed astrophysical features of the 21 cm lightcone images but also reduces required computational resources by one to two orders of magnitude.","The paper adopts a two-step training procedure using GANs to build a multi-fidelity emulator. Initially, a modified StyleGAN2 architecture is trained on 120,000 small-scale images generated from 30,000 21CMFAST simulations. These simulations, with a resolution of \((64,64,512)\) and a cell size of \((2\,\mathrm{Mpc})^{3}\), capture the evolution of ionized bubbles and the cosmic web over a comoving length of \((128,128,1024)\,\mathrm{Mpc}\) and a redshift range of \(7.51 < z < 11.93\). The network incorporates a mapping network to process astrophysical parameters and a synthesis network that progressively generates images with injected noise for diversity. Regularization schemes, including \(r_1\) loss for the discriminator and path-length loss for the generator, are employed along with a cross-domain correspondence (CDC) loss—calculated using cosine similarity and KL divergence—to ensure the model’s stability and the diversity of its outputs. In the second stage, the GAN is refined with a limited set of 320 large-scale images originated from 80 simulations, each with a resolution of \((256,256,512)\) and spanning \((512,512,1024)\,\mathrm{Mpc}\), using a patchy-level generator and a layer-frozen multi-scale discriminator. Furthermore, detailed training configurations are provided: the small-scale GAN was trained on four Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs for 40,000 iterations (totaling about 320 GPU hours), while the large-scale GAN required two GPUs over 2,800 iterations (around 10 GPU hours). The use of few-shot transfer learning enables the adaptation of the model without the need for an extensive new dataset, thereby efficiently bridging small and large scales.","The results from the study confirm that the transfer-learned GAN achieves high precision on both small and large scales. For the small-scale GAN, visual comparisons demonstrate that the model can accurately reproduce the evolution of ionized bubbles in the \(T_b\) field as well as the cosmic web in the \(\delta_m\) field. Quantitatively, the global \(T_b\) signal is emulated with subpercent relative error for larger values and slightly higher errors for lower values, while the 2D power spectrum (PS) shows relative errors mostly below 20% and scattering transform (ST) coefficients \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) exhibit errors below 10%. For the large-scale GAN, trained via the few-shot strategy over 2,800 epochs with just 320 images, visual assessments indicate improved image quality with seamless concatenation. The global \(T_b\) signal in the large-scale images attains errors below 5% in most cases, although during early reionization the error can exceed 10% for the parameter set \((\log_{10} \zeta = 2.05,\,\log_{10} T_{\mathrm{vir}} = 4.5)\). Moreover, the small-scale PS errors remain below 10% while errors on very large scales (\(k \lesssim 0.02\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\)) can exceed 30%, likely due to limited training data. Tests for mode collapse using visual checks and variance assessments further confirm that the network maintains diversity in the generated images with only minor issues noted at particular scales and parameter combinations.","The study’s findings illustrate that the multi-fidelity emulation approach through few-shot transfer learning is highly effective in replicating complex astrophysical simulations. The small-scale GAN lays a robust foundation by achieving high-fidelity reproductions of both large-scale patterns and fine details, as evidenced by the close agreement in both power spectrum and scattering transform coefficients. The subsequent fine-tuning with a limited number of large-scale simulations effectively transfers these capabilities to larger images, with fidelity maintained on small scales and acceptable degradation on very large scales. The use of advanced regularization techniques and careful network modifications ensures that the GAN retains both visual authenticity and quantitative accuracy, demonstrating that even with minimal large-scale data, the risk of mode collapse is minimal and the key astrophysical features are faithfully reproduced.","This work has significant implications for the future of astrophysical simulations and analysis. By reducing computational costs by one to two orders of magnitude—as well as saving 90–99% of the resources compared to full large-scale training—the few-shot transfer learning approach paves the way for cost-effective, high-fidelity emulation of complex astrophysical phenomena. The demonstrated effectiveness of the multi-fidelity emulation method suggests that similar strategies could be applied to other domains that involve a trade-off between resolution and computational expense, such as transitioning between semi-numerical and full-numerical simulations or across varying resolution scales. Moreover, future explorations into alternative generative models like normalizing flows or variational autoencoders may further enhance the versatility and applicability of these methods in astrophysical and cosmological research."
2502.03782,Classification of Solar Radio Spectrum Based on Swin Transformer,Jian Chen et al.,"Solar radio observations play a crucial role in space weather early warning and solar physics research by detecting and classifying solar radio bursts. These observations capture information where the vertical axis represents frequency and the horizontal axis represents time, with pixel values indicating solar radio flux—high flux appears white and low flux black. The dataset used in this study is sourced from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Solar Broadband Spectrometer (SBRS) and comprises 4408 solar radio spectrums categorized into burst, nonburst, and calibration types. Owing to internal and external interference, the data naturally contains noise, necessitating careful preprocessing to ensure accuracy in subsequent analyses.","Traditional classification methods, which often rely on convolutional neural networks, are resource-intensive and suffer from high parameter counts, making them less viable for real-time applications. In addition, solar radio bursts are extremely rare—accounting for less than \(0.5\%\) of the total observation time with only 579 burst samples in the dataset. These limitations create a pressing need for a more efficient approach that reduces computational resources while maintaining high classification accuracy. This study is motivated by the goal to address these challenges by integrating a novel Swin transformer model with transfer learning techniques.","The methodology centers on leveraging the Swin transformer combined with transfer learning to efficiently classify solar radio spectrums. The process begins with careful preprocessing where grayscale images are normalized to mitigate nonlinear effects, using the equation","\[
g(x, y)=f(x, y)-\frac{1}{n} \sum_{x=0}^{n} f(x, y)+\frac{1}{nm} \sum_{x=0}^{m} \sum_{y=0}^{n} f(x, y),
\]","with \(m\) and \(n\) representing the pixel counts along the x and y axes. Following normalization, the images undergo pseudocolor conversion using a mapping table and are resized to form three-channel \(224 \times 224 \times 3\) images via bilinear interpolation. For a target pixel \(g(x, y)\), the interpolation incorporates values from neighboring pixels:","\[
g(x, y)=a+b+c+d,
\]"
2502.03683,Ruling out AGNs as the dominant source of cosmic reionization with JWST,Danyang Jiang et al.,"Cosmic reionization, the final major phase transition of the intergalactic medium (IGM), has long been at the center of debates regarding the source of ionizing Lyman continuum (LyC) photons. Traditionally, galaxies were considered the primary contributors to reionization, albeit with uncertainties stemming from low escape fractions (\(f_{\text{esc}}\))—often only a few percent in low-redshift systems—while theoretical models demand \(f_{\text{esc}}\) exceeding 10–15% for these galaxies to be solely responsible. Direct detection of LyC emission is complicated by absorption in the IGM, leaving the relative contributions of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) uncertain. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have unveiled a high density of faint AGN candidates at high redshift, a discovery that has reopened discussions on whether AGNs could significantly contribute to the cosmic ionizing photon budget.","The motivation behind this study lies in resolving the controversy surrounding the dominant source of reionization. While the standard picture favored galaxies, the emergence of numerous faint AGN candidates—detected with JWST—prompted an investigation into whether AGNs might play a leading role in producing LyC photons during the epoch of reionization (EoR). The research was aimed at setting a definitive upper bound on the AGN contribution using robust methods and deep JWST imaging, thereby addressing whether the observed AGN population could viably account for a substantial fraction of the required ionizing emissivity.","To set an absolute upper limit on the AGN contribution, the study constructed a highly complete sample of objects—including both galaxies and potential AGNs—spanning the narrow redshift range \(7.15 \leq z \leq 7.75\). The initial selection was based on data from the JADES program’s photometric catalog and further refined using the F090W – F115W color criterion. Deep JWST NIRCam images from the GOODS fields were processed using a comprehensive reduction pipeline involving raw uncal.fits files treated through the JWST Calibration Pipeline (v1.12.5), CEERS NIRCam imaging scripts, and custom codes. The processing involved several stages including detector-level corrections, flat-fielding, flux calibration, and the creation of mosaics using TweakregStep, resulting in drizzled images with a pixel scale of \(0.03\).","Each object in the final sample of 156 candidates underwent image decomposition in the rest-frame far-UV, wherein the observed profile was separated into a point-source component (assumed to be an AGN) and an extended component. Aperture photometry was performed with a circular aperture of diameter \(D=0.24\), and rigorous techniques were applied using PSF and Sérsic profile fitting (with the Sérsic index restrained to \(n < 5\)) via GalfitM. This decomposition allowed the researchers to measure the AGN fraction as the ratio of point-source flux to total flux. Further, the AGN ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) was determined using the \(1/V_a\) method, incorporating simulations to estimate sample completeness and employing a double power-law (DPL) parameterization with a fixed bright-end slope of \(\beta=-2.78\). Additionally, rigorous \(k\)-corrections based on simulated quasar spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were applied to derive \(M_{1450}\) magnitudes, with integration carried out over the luminosity range \(M_{1450} = -30\) to \(-15\) mag.","# Results  
The analysis revealed that the AGN UV LF, parameterized by a double power-law with best-fit parameters \(\alpha=-1.70_{-0.25}^{+0.44}\) and \(M_{1450}^{*}=-17.81_{-1.35}^{+1.06}\) mag, and normalized by \(\Phi^{*}=10^{-3.7}\, \mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\, mag^{-1}}\), exhibits a persistently high faint-end density without a distinct “knee.” The integration of the ionizing photon density, assuming a 100% escape fraction and a broken power-law SED characterized by \(f_{v} \propto v^{-0.61}\) for \(\lambda > 912\,\mathring{A}\) and \(f_{v} \propto v^{-1.70}\) for \(\lambda < 912\,\mathring{A}\), yielded a total AGN ionizing emissivity comparable to the reionization requirement calculated as  
\[
\dot{N}_{\text{ion}}(z) = 10^{50.48}\left(\frac{C}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1+z}{7}\right)^3 \, \mathrm{Mpc^{-3}\, s^{-1}},
\]
with \(C=3\). This quantitative analysis constrains the AGN contribution fraction, \(f_{\mathrm{AGN}}\), to be no more than \(33_{-4}^{+6}\%\) of the required LyC photons. These results are dominated by the low-luminosity AGN population and represent a stringent upper bound without assuming the nature of compact galaxy cores.","# Interpretation  
The findings conclusively indicate that AGNs, even under highly optimistic assumptions such as a 100% escape fraction and complete attribution of point-source flux to AGN activity, contribute at most about one third of the ionizing photon budget necessary for reionization. This limitation strongly supports the interpretation that star-forming galaxies are, in fact, the dominant sources driving cosmic reionization during the EoR. Moreover, the conservative methodological choices—including potential overestimation of AGN flux—suggest that the actual AGN contribution could be even lower than the quantified upper bound. Thus, despite the higher than expected faint-end density of AGNs revealed by JWST, their role remains subdominant in the context of reionization."
2502.03853,VERITAS and Multiwavelength Observations of Blazar B3 2247+381 in Response to an IceCube Neutrino Alert,R. Abbasi et al.,"Blazars, a subtype of active galactic nuclei with jets directed toward Earth, are among the most promising candidates for producing ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and astrophysical neutrinos. The VERITAS Collaboration, together with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, has been investigating these extreme cosmic environments to understand the mechanisms responsible for high-energy emissions. Previous detections and the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux identified by IceCube, combined with observations of other sources such as TXS 0506+056 and NGC 1068, have reinforced the view that blazars may be key players in the acceleration of cosmic particles without suffering significant attenuation between the source and Earth.","The primary scientific goal of this study was to search for potential neutrino sources by correlating high-energy gamma-ray emissions with neutrino events. A recent IceCube multiplet alert in 2022, associated with the blazar B3 2247+381, provided a timely opportunity to perform a detailed multiwavelength follow-up. Investigators aimed to detect possible signatures of enhanced emission activity that might indicate a blazar functioning as a cosmic neutrino source. In doing so, the study sought to improve our understanding of the processes driving blazar emissions and to test whether hadronic processes contribute substantially to the observed photon spectra.","Multiple instruments were employed to assemble a comprehensive spectral energy distribution (SED) of B3 2247+381 and to monitor its temporal behavior. VERITAS, an array of four 12 m imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes sensitive to gamma rays in the 85 GeV–30 TeV range, conducted approximately five hours of observations in “wobble” mode following the IceCube alert (MJD 59845–59855). The analysis, which made use of Eventdisplay and VEGAS software, applied standard quality cuts and background estimation methods. Complementary data were obtained from Fermi-LAT, which analyzed gamma rays in the energy band 100 MeV–300 GeV over both the alert window (MJD 59719–59893) and a longer period (MJD 54683–60096) using PASS 8 Instrument Response Functions and binned likelihood techniques. Hard X-ray observations from NuSTAR provided a crucial detection in the 3–79 keV energy band, while Swift-XRT and Swift-UVOT offered soft X-ray and optical–UV data, respectively. Long-term optical monitoring was additionally conducted by ASAS-SN, ATLAS, and optical telescopes at FLWO. The entire multiwavelength dataset was interpreted through SED modeling, fitted with a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) scenario using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. This method incorporated nine free parameters—including blob characteristics (\(\delta\), \(B\), \(R\)) and parameters defining the electron energy distribution (such as \(N_e\), \(n_1\), \(n_2\), \(\gamma_{\text{break}}\), \(\gamma_{\min}\), and \(\gamma_{\max}\))—with a fixed redshift of \(z=0.119\). The MCMC involved 100 walkers over 5000 steps with a burn-in phase of 1000 steps, achieving a reduced chi-square of \(\chi_{\text{red}}^2=1.14\).","The VERITAS observations of B3 2247+381 did not reveal a statistically significant detection, yielding an excess of 11 events (approximately 0.88\(\sigma\)) and establishing a 99% flux upper limit of \(3.6 \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}\) above 200 GeV. Archival VERITAS data from 2009 to 2020 also showed only a marginal excess (2.2\(\sigma\)) with an upper flux limit of \(1.7 \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}\), indicating no intrinsic variability. The Fermi-LAT analysis registered a non-detection during the alert period but found the source at a 23\(\sigma\) significance level (TS=542.3) when analyzing an extended timeframe, with a power-law flux of \((2.84 \pm 0.42) \times 10^{-9}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}\). NuSTAR observations resulted in a definitive hard X-ray detection at 42\(\sigma\); spectral fitting with an absorbed power law produced a photon index of \(\Gamma = 2.89 \pm 0.12\) and a flux of \((1.45 \pm 0.05) \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{erg~cm}^{-2}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}\). Complementary observations from Swift-XRT, Swift-UVOT, and various optical instruments confirmed the source’s presence across several energy bands, although no significant variability was observed in gamma-ray or optical bands during the alert period. The assembled SED was well described by the one-zone SSC model, with parameters that were largely consistent with those inferred from previous MAGIC observations, despite some large uncertainties.","The comprehensive multiwavelength analysis indicates that the emission from B3 2247+381 is consistent with a one-zone leptonic synchrotron self-Compton model. The absence of significant variability or flaring activity in the gamma-ray and optical regimes during the IceCube alert, despite the pronounced hard X-ray detection by NuSTAR, suggests that the blazar did not enter an enhanced emission state that might be expected if it were the source of the triggering neutrino signal. Furthermore, while hadronic models generally require elevated photon flux levels to support processes such as \(p\gamma\) interactions, the observed low fluxes across several bands are incompatible with such scenarios. Consequently, the neutrino alert is interpreted as likely resulting from a background fluctuation rather than a genuine correlation with B3 2247+381.","The findings underscore the challenges inherent in associating neutrino alerts with specific astrophysical sources, particularly in the context of blazar observations. The study demonstrates that even in the presence of comprehensive multiwavelength follow-up efforts, the absence of coordinated flaring across energy bands can rule out certain emission scenarios, thereby refining our understanding of emission mechanisms in blazars. This work highlights the necessity for improved localization techniques, enhanced real-time event selection methods, and more sensitive future neutrino detectors—such as IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT—to better resolve cosmic ray origins and the astrophysical circumstances under which neutrinos are produced."
2502.04300,CMB-S4: Foreground-Cleaning Pipeline Comparison for Measuring Primordial Gravitational Waves,Federico Bianchini et al.,"The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) provides a unique window into the early Universe, where subtle polarization signatures such as \(B\)-modes may reveal the presence of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) from inflation. The tensor-to-scalar ratio \(r\) is a critical parameter that quantifies the amplitude of these gravitational waves, permitting discrimination among inflationary models, including Starobinsky and Higgs inflation, and probing energy scales far beyond those accessible in particle colliders. Recent experiments, notably CMB-S4, aim to constrain \(r\) to levels as low as \(r \leq 0.001\) or to detect a signal at \(r \geq 0.003\) with high statistical significance. The challenge, however, lies in the faintness of the signal in the presence of contaminating lensing-induced \(B\)-modes and Galactic foreground emissions, which include contributions from dust and synchrotron processes. Detailed simulations incorporating lensed CMB maps, realistic Galactic foreground models of varying complexity, and instrumental noise (characterized by a \(1/f\) spectrum with parameters such as \(\ell_{\text{knee}}=60\) and slopes ranging from \(-1.7\) to \(-3.0\)) provide the foundation for evaluating innovative foreground-cleaning techniques.","The quest to detect and accurately measure \(r\) is not only essential for testing the inflationary paradigm but also pivotal for exploring physics at energy scales unreachable by terrestrial experiments. Given the inherent difficulties in disentangling the relatively weak PGW signal from dominant foregrounds and lensing effects, there is a pressing need to refine component separation methods. This study is motivated by the desire to compare and validate three distinct foreground-cleaning pipelines under the realistic conditions forecast for CMB-S4 observations. By rigorously assessing the performance—through metrics such as \(\sigma(r)\), detection significance, and bias estimates—across simple Gaussian foregrounds to highly complex non-Gaussian and spatially varying cases, the work endeavors to ensure that future \(r\) analyses are both robust and reliable. Key to this effort is understanding how uncertainties and biases evolve when foreground residuals are marginally modeled or when delensing strategies are deployed.","Three foreground-cleaning pipelines are evaluated using simulations of the South Pole Deep Patch. The study employs a combination of map-based and power-spectrum-based approaches. One method utilizes a parametric maximum likelihood applied to auto- and cross-power spectra (Pipeline A), where a multi-component sky model—incorporating lensed \(\Lambda\)CDM, PGW \(B\)-modes, and Galactic dust and synchrotron emissions—is fitted using parameters such as amplitudes (\(A_{\mathrm{d}}, A_{\mathrm{s}}\)) and spectral slopes (\(\alpha_{\mathrm{d}}, \alpha_{\mathrm{s}}\)) with an additional correlation parameter \(\epsilon\). A Gaussian prior is incorporated into the likelihood for the sky signal \(\mathbf{s}\), modeled as a Gaussian random field with covariance \(\mathbf{S}\), leading to a Wiener filter solution \( \hat{\mathbf{s}} = \mathbf{S A}^{T}(\mathbf{N} + \mathbf{A S A}^{T})^{-1} \mathbf{d}\) and a modified internal linear combination (ILC) estimator that is unbiased and depends on the total variance \(\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{N} + \mathbf{A S A}^{T}\). Pipeline B employs a non-parametric ILC method in harmonic space to construct a foreground-cleaned CMB map using weights derived from estimated covariance matrices such as \(\hat{\mathbf{C}}_{\ell}=\frac{1}{2 \ell+1}\sum_{m}\mathbf{d}_{\ell m}\mathbf{d}_{\ell m}^{\dagger}\); this method is further refined by excluding modes prone to bias from CMB–foreground correlations. Pipeline C adopts a two-step parametric maximum-likelihood approach that first estimates foreground spectral parameters, then reconstructs component maps using least-squares estimation, making use of a mixing matrix \(\mathbf{F}\) and pre-whitening operators derived from spin-2 spherical harmonics. In addition to component separation, an iterative internal delensing algorithm is implemented to mitigate \(E\)-to-\(B\) leakage; this approach constructs a lensing \(B\)-mode template via \( \hat{B}^{\mathrm{LT}} \equiv \hat{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}^{\mathrm{MAP}} \circ \hat{E}^{\text{unl}} \), where \(\hat{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}^{\mathrm{MAP}}\) is the maximum a posteriori deflection field and \(\hat{E}^{\text{unl}}\) is the Wiener-filtered \(E\)-mode map. The simulations incorporate CMB maps based on Planck FFP10 parameters, multiple foreground models ranging from simple isotropic Gaussian (Model 0) to complex non-Gaussian cases with spatially varying spectral energy distributions (SEDs) (Models 1 and 2), as well as PySM models (3–5) that introduce frequency decorrelation and three-dimensional dust emission. Instrumental noise is modeled using the \(1/f\) noise law 
\[
N_{\ell} = \Delta_{P}^{2}\left[1+\left(\frac{\ell}{\ell_{\text{knee}}}\right)^{\alpha_{\text{knee}}}\right],
\]
with appropriate rescaling based on NET ratios and detector-years.","Across the three pipelines, the analyses yield comparable performance for Gaussian and intermediate foreground complexities with uncertainties in \(r\) characterized by \(\sigma(r)\) in the range of \(3 \times 10^{-4}\) to \(5 \times 10^{-4}\). For simple foreground models, all pipelines recover unbiased estimates of \(r\) at the null level, while for \(r=0.003\) they predict detections at around \(5 \sigma\). In the presence of complex, non-Gaussian foregrounds (Model 2), biases in the estimate of \(r\) emerge at the level of \(1-2\sigma\), and Pipeline B in particular exhibits an increase of up to \(70\%\) in \(\sigma(r)\). Marginalization over residuals effectively reduces biases to less than \(0.1 \sigma\), albeit at the cost of inflating the uncertainties by 29–100%, and resulting in detection significances falling to 2–4 \(\sigma\) for \(r=0.003\). Detailed comparisons of auto- and cross-\(B B\) spectra across the pipelines show that residual contamination is sensitive to assumptions on the dust spectral index \(\beta_{\mathrm{d}}\) and spatial variation in the SEDs, with Pipeline A emerging as the most robust overall. Further analyses using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods via Cobaya applied to PySM foreground models reinforce these findings, noting that while Pipeline A remains unbiased irrespective of model complexity, slight positive biases appear in Pipeline B and significant challenges are encountered by Pipeline C when handling highly complex residuals.","The results underscore the effectiveness of parametric and non-parametric component separation techniques in recovering the faint PGW signal, particularly when the foregrounds are well-behaved and represented by simple models. The comparable performance of the pipelines for Gaussian and amplitude-modulated scenarios suggests that the underlying assumptions in both penalized likelihood and ILC approaches are sufficiently robust under these conditions. However, the emergence of \(1\sigma\) to \(2\sigma\) biases in complex foreground environments highlights the sensitivity of the estimation of \(r\) to the fidelity of the foreground modeling. In particular, fixed spectral indices and spatially invariant weighting schemes limit the flexibility of some methods, thereby increasing residual contamination. The iterative delensing procedure—a critical innovation in reducing sample variance—demonstrates a marked reduction in uncertainty, with reductions in \(\sigma(r)\) by factors of 10 for \(r=0\) and 6 for \(r=0.003\). Overall, the variations in performance across pipelines suggest that while delensing and advanced likelihood formulations are effective, accurate modeling of non-Gaussian, spatially varying foregrounds remains a challenging frontier.","The study has significant implications for future CMB experiments aimed at probing inflationary physics. The demonstration of robust performance by Pipeline A, and the identified limitations of Pipelines B and C in the face of complex foregrounds, emphasizes the necessity for cross-pipeline validation and the development of more flexible foreground residual models—such as those incorporating spatially varying SEDs or multi-patch approaches. The ability to reduce uncertainty and bias through effective delensing and residual marginalization is crucial for achieving reliable detections of PGWs. Consequently, future work must address challenges such as anisotropic noise, instrumental systematics, and site-specific observational complexities, drawing on insights from the South Pole investigations to optimize strategies for ultra-low noise foreground separation. The refined understanding of component separation techniques gained here will directly impact the design and data analysis pipelines for next-generation CMB experiments and ultimately advance our understanding of cosmic inflation."
2502.04158,Diffusion-based mass map reconstruction from weak lensing data,Supranta S. Boruah et al.,"The era of Stage IV cosmological surveys such as Euclid, LSST, and the Roman Space Telescope promises an unprecedented influx of high-quality data, necessitating advanced methods to analyze weak gravitational lensing. Weak lensing, which distorts galaxy shapes by the large-scale distribution of matter, offers a direct probe of the underlying dark matter distribution while avoiding biases associated with traditional tracers. The lensing signal is characterized by the shear field \( \gamma \) and its relation to the convergence field \( \kappa \), as expressed by the equation  
\[
\kappa(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \int_{0}^{\chi_{\mathrm{H}}} d\chi\, g(\chi)\,\delta(\chi\boldsymbol{\theta}, \chi),
\]  
with \( g(\chi) \) representing the lensing efficiency, and the Kaiser-Squires transform providing a bridge between the Fourier transforms of \( \kappa \) and \( \gamma \). In addition, noisy shear maps, influenced by shape noise that is independent across pixels, necessitate sophisticated mass map reconstructions to capture the non-Gaussian aspects of the matter distribution that traditional two-point statistics typically overlook.","The motivation for this work arises from the need to extract comprehensive cosmological information from weak lensing data beyond the constraints of traditional analyses. As standard methods relying on two-point statistics fail to capture significant non-Gaussian features, there is a clear impetus to develop advanced approaches such as field-level inference (FLI) and deep learning techniques using convolutional neural networks. Additionally, conventional Bayesian strategies employing Gaussian or lognormal priors are insufficient for the highly non-Gaussian late-time convergence fields observed due to gravitational dynamics. In this context, a diffusion-based framework offers a promising alternative, capable of generating high-resolution, simulation-quality mass maps while accurately reproducing both power spectra and higher-order statistics, thereby paving the way for improved cluster detection, covariance estimation, and analysis of cosmic structures like filaments and voids.","A unified diffusion model is developed to serve both as a generative mechanism for weak lensing maps and as an inverse tool for mass map reconstruction from noisy shear data through Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). The forward process progressively adds noise to the images according to a stochastic differential equation (SDE):  
\[
\mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{x} = f(\boldsymbol{x}, t)\,\mathrm{d}t + g(t)\,\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{w},
\]  
while the reverse process employs the score function \( \nabla_{\boldsymbol{x}} \log p_t(\boldsymbol{x}) \) to guide denoising, represented as  
\[
\mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{x} = \left[f(\boldsymbol{x}, t) - g^2(t)\nabla_{\boldsymbol{x}} \log p_t(\boldsymbol{x})\right]\mathrm{d}t + g(t)\,\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{w}.
\]  
A neural network, implemented as a UNet with approximately 35 million parameters, approximates the score function, enabling the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to discretize the diffusion process into 1000 timesteps. The training employs convergence maps from the MassiveNuS simulation suite across redshifts \( z = 0.5, 1.0, \) and \( 1.5 \), with the maps regridded to a resolution of \( 256 \times 256 \) pixels and supplemented by noisy mock shear data that mimic LSST-Y10 survey characteristics. To address the inherent bias introduced by early sampling steps in DPS, a scaling parameter  
\[
A(t) = \operatorname{Sigmoid}\left[\frac{\bar{t} - t}{\sigma_t}\right],
\]  
with empirically determined values \(\bar{t} = 500\) and \(\sigma_t = 20\), is incorporated to downweight the likelihood gradient, ensuring an unbiased reconstruction.","The diffusion model successfully generates high-resolution (sub-arcminute) convergence maps whose statistical properties closely match simulation data. Validation is provided through accurate recovery of power spectra with biases less than 1%, as well as non-Gaussian features quantified by scattering transforms  
\[
S_1(j_1) = \langle|\kappa * \psi(j_1)|\rangle \quad \text{and} \quad S_2(j_1, j_2) = \langle||\kappa * \psi(j_1)| * \psi(j_2)|\rangle.
\]  
When applied to reconstruct mass maps from noisy shear data via DPS, 100 posterior samples are generated, each taking approximately \(\mathcal{O}(50)\) seconds on an NVIDIA TESLA V100 GPU. The ensemble mean of these posterior maps closely approximates the true underlying convergence, with the spatially correlated uncertainties delineated by the standard deviation. Furthermore, pixel-by-pixel root mean square error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient \( \rho_{c} \) metrics demonstrate approximately a 50% improvement over the standard Kaiser-Squires inversion, particularly evident in low-redshift bins. These results affirm that the diffusion-based approach effectively recovers both the two-point and non-Gaussian statistical properties of the mass distribution.","The results indicate that leveraging a diffusion-based framework for mass mapping enables an unbiased and accurate reconstruction of the underlying convergence field from noisy weak lensing data. The high fidelity in reproducing power spectra, combined with the accurate capture of non-Gaussian scattering transforms, suggests that the diffusion model is adept at learning the complex joint distribution of cosmic structures. The improved metrics relative to conventional methods, such as reduced RMSE and enhanced Pearson correlation, highlight the model’s capacity to mitigate biases that arise from early sampling steps. Overall, the successful integration of Diffusion Posterior Sampling within this framework demonstrates its potential for quantitatively robust cosmological analysis.","The advancements demonstrated by this diffusion-based approach have significant implications for cosmological research. Its computational efficiency—generating convergence maps in approximately 10 seconds on a GPU and reconstructing full posterior maps in roughly 50 seconds per sample—positions it as a powerful alternative to traditional \(N\)-body simulations and other mass mapping techniques. The ability to accurately reconstruct mass maps and estimate covariance matrices will enhance studies of large-scale structure by enabling unbiased cluster detection and detailed analysis of filaments and voids. This method not only improves the fidelity of weak lensing analyses but also lays the groundwork for future field-level cosmological inference, potentially transforming the interpretation of forthcoming high-quality survey data."
2502.03861,Analysis of Newly Catalogued Open Star Cluster UPK 220 with Gaia DR3 and TESS: Discovering Member Variable Stars,İncí Akkaya Oralhan et al.,"Open clusters (OCs) are gravitationally bound stellar assemblies that play a crucial role in studies of star formation, stellar evolution, and Galactic dynamics. They are typically classified by age into young (\(<10^6\) yr), intermediate-age (\(10^6-10^7\) yr), and old (\(>10^7\) yr) groups, each providing unique insights into coeval evolutionary processes. The Gaia mission, particularly Gaia DR3, has greatly expanded the census of these clusters by enabling precise analyses of essential parameters—such as distance, age, metallicity, and reddening—and by facilitating the identification of variable stars. This context underscores the importance of investigating OCs like UPK 220 to enhance our understanding of the underlying physics of stellar systems.","The focus on the intermediate-age open cluster UPK 220 is driven by the need to leverage state-of-the-art datasets, notably Gaia DR3 and TESS photometry, in order to refine membership analyses and to detect and characterize variable stars within the cluster. By integrating these complementary observational resources, the study aims to tightly constrain both the cluster’s fundamental properties and the individual traits of its member stars. This integrated approach is designed to further illuminate the dynamics of stellar evolution and contribute to a more detailed picture of Galactic structure.","The investigation utilizes Gaia DR3 astrometric and photometric data gathered within a 30-arcmin radius around UPK 220, applying the pyUPMASK algorithm to differentiate 163 bona fide cluster members from field stars. The selection is based on key parameters such as the proper motions \( \mu_{\alpha} \) and \( \mu_{\delta} \), parallax \( \varpi \), and multi-band photometry, resulting in a median parallax of \( \varpi = 1.03 \pm 0.03 \) mas and proper motion values of \( (\mu_{\alpha}, \mu_{\delta}) = (-2.41 \pm 0.11, -2.64 \pm 0.12) \) mas/yr. A King profile fit to the radial density distribution provided structural parameters, namely a core radius \( R_c = 5.751 \pm 1.079 \) arcmin and a limiting radius \( R_{\mathrm{lim}} = 24.0 \) arcmin. In parallel, TESS data spanning 124.29 days and covering five sectors were processed using lightkurve and TESScut to extract light curves of cluster members. Eight variable stars were identified and classified—three eclipsing binaries, two pulsating stars, two magnetically active stars, and one rotating star—with periodic variability confirmed for features exhibiting signal-to-noise ratios \( \geq 4 \). Eclipsing binaries were modeled via the JKTEBOP tool to derive orbital and limb darkening parameters from TESS bandpass data. Additionally, stellar atmospheric properties (\( T_{\text{eff}} \), \( \log g \), and \([Fe/H]\)) for selected variables were determined using GSP-Phot, GSP-Spec, and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting through the ARIADNE package. To estimate the fundamental parameters of UPK 220, the MESA code was employed using standard mixing length theory along with OPAL opacity tables; iterative refinements of metallicity, age, and reddening were achieved by fitting isochrones with the automated Metalcode tool.","The analysis confirmed the identification of 163 cluster members from Gaia DR3 data, with the median parallax and proper motion values providing a robust astrometric foundation. Structural analysis yielded a core radius of \( R_c = 5.751 \pm 1.079 \) arcmin and a limiting radius of \( R_{\mathrm{lim}} = 24.0 \) arcmin based on a King profile fit. TESS observations enabled the discovery of eight variable stars within the cluster: three eclipsing binaries (notably IDs 29, 67, and 116), two pulsating variables (IDs 49 and 138), two magnetic active stars (IDs 16 and 42), and one rotating star (ID 147). Detailed analyses revealed eclipsing binary systems exhibiting ellipsoidal variations and period characteristics—with ID 29 displaying detached binary features and ID 67 hosting a Cepheid-like pulsating component with a period of approximately 2.5 days. The study further detailed the variability of other objects, with rotational and pulsation periods ranging from \(0.6663 \pm 0.0028\) days in a \(\gamma\) Dor variable to \(3.061 \pm 0.025\) days in a star displaying spot modulations suggestive of magnetic activity. Temperature estimates across the sample spanned from about 4419 K to 8577 K, and masses were modeled to lie between 0.6 \(M_{\odot}\) and 1.5 \(M_{\odot}\). By incorporating MESA and MIST isochrone fittings, the best-fit cluster parameters were determined as a distance \(d = 832\) pc, a reddening \(E(G_{BP}-G_{RP}) = 1.10\) mag (with corresponding \(E(B-V) = 1.0\) mag), an age range from 110 Myr to 200 Myr depending on metallicity assumptions, and a metallicity around \([Fe/H] \approx -0.56\). The color-magnitude diagram (CMD) produced from Gaia DR3 data, alongside the TESS light curves, further corroborated the positions and variability characteristics of both binary and single variables within UPK 220.","The comprehensive astrometric and photometric analysis confirms that the member selection process effectively distinguishes UPK 220 from background stars, as evidenced by consistent proper motion measurements and structural parameters. The detection of diverse variability types, from eclipsing binaries that demonstrate significant light curve modulations to pulsating and magnetically active stars, provides nuanced insights into the evolutionary states of the cluster’s constituents. The comparison between GaiaDR3 data and model outputs, such as the slight variations in distance moduli dependent on metallicity assumptions, underscores the precision and challenges inherent in reconciling observational data with theoretical models. Moreover, the detailed spectral and photometric analyses of individual stars contribute to understanding the complex interactions between stellar rotation, pulsation, and binary evolution within an intermediate-age cluster.","By integrating Gaia DR3 and TESS datasets, this study advances a multifaceted approach to understanding the astrophysical properties of open clusters like UPK 220. The successful identification and characterization of variable stars, along with precise determinations of cluster parameters, have meaningful implications for refining stellar evolution models and enhancing the modeling of binary systems. These findings not only improve our comprehension of star formation processes and internal cluster dynamics but also contribute to broader Galactic structure studies by providing benchmark data on metallicity, age, and distance. Ultimately, the methodology and results set a precedent for future work aimed at exploring the intricate relationships between stellar properties and evolution within diverse Galactic environments."
2502.04169,The Effects of Kinematic MHD on the Atmospheric Circulation of Eccentric Hot Jupiters,Hayley Beltz et al.,"Hot Jupiters are massive exoplanets typically characterized by short orbital periods and circular, tidally synchronized orbits that lead to permanent dayside and nightside configurations. Classical 3D general circulation models (GCMs) predict broad, superrotating equatorial jets driven by extreme temperature gradients. However, eccentric hot Jupiters depart from this norm; prior studies, such as those by Kataria et al. (2013) and Lewis et al. (2014), have demonstrated that eccentricity not only narrows and strengthens the equatorial jet but also induces mid-latitude westward winds and increases day–night temperature contrasts. In addition, magnetic drag—especially significant above approximately \(1500\,\mathrm{K}\)—has been recognized as a key factor in shaping atmospheric dynamics, with non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models indicating time-varying hotspot offsets. These findings provide a compelling backdrop for investigating the more complex dynamics present in eccentric hot Jupiter atmospheres.","The primary impetus for this study arises from the need to improve atmospheric predictions for eccentric hot Jupiters by incorporating a temperature-dependent magnetic drag prescription into GCMs. Previous models that employed uniform drag approximations failed to capture the nuanced interplay between the planet’s orbital eccentricity, time-varying stellar irradiation, and magnetic effects. With eccentric planets like TOI-150b experiencing significant variations in stellar flux and atmospheric conditions, it becomes essential to understand how magnetic fields—ranging from 0 to 30 Gauss—modify circulation patterns, influence thermal structures, and leave distinct signatures in emission spectra. This work is motivated by both the theoretical challenges of modeling such complex systems and the observational opportunities presented by modern high-resolution spectroscopy to probe these dynamics.","The study employs a three-dimensional RM-GCM that solves the primitive equations for atmospheric circulation, coupled with an updated picket fence radiative transfer scheme to model opacities in five bands (two thermal and three starlight). Analytic coefficients account for variations in temperature, depth, metallicity, and stellar flux. A temperature-dependent magnetic drag timescale, \(\tau_{\text{mag}}\), derived from non-ideal MHD equations is introduced as a Rayleigh drag applied solely in the east–west momentum component, assuming a dipole magnetic field aligned with the planet’s rotation axis. A suite of simulations was run for the eccentric hot Jupiter TOI-150b—with an eccentricity \(e=0.26\)—across five different magnetic field strengths (0 G, 3 G, 10 G, and 30 G), along with an additional circular model for baseline comparisons, each evolved over 1000 orbits. Post-processing produced high-resolution (R = 100,000) emission spectra that incorporate Doppler broadening effects, as well as low-resolution (R = 150) spectra calculated near apastron and periastron where wind-induced broadening was excluded. Chemical equilibrium and solar abundances were assumed, with opacities sourced from the ExoMol database. In parallel, clouds and vertical mixing were explored using the 1D radiative–convective model EGP+, incorporating cloud cases with varying particle sizes and vertical extents via sedimentation efficiencies \(f_{\text{sed}}=3\), 1, and 0.5, as well as a cloud-free scenario.","The simulations reveal that eccentricity alone significantly alters the atmospheric dynamics of TOI-150b by narrowing the equatorial jet, inducing high-latitude westward winds, and causing phase-dependent thermal inversions that are most pronounced near periastron. When magnetic drag is incorporated using the temperature-dependent prescription, stronger magnetic fields—particularly at 10 G and 30 G—diminish the equatorial jet’s strength and extend the westward wind patterns to mid-latitudes. This drag amplifies the thermal inversions near periastron due to the dominance of radiative over advective timescales, where the radiative timescale is defined as  
\[
\tau_{rad} = \frac{P}{g} \frac{c_p}{4 \sigma T^3}
\]
and the advective timescale as  
\[
\tau_{adv} = \frac{R}{U}.
\]
High-resolution emission spectra in the 2.3–2.35 \(\mu\)m range display increased flux near periastron owing to heightened irradiation, while Doppler broadening is noticeably reduced by magnetic drag—especially in the 10 G scenario which exhibits the smallest net velocity shifts. The models also capture phase curves with peak flux occurring slightly before periastron, and differences in net Doppler shifts that vary over the orbit, with eccentric models generally showing net redshift except for minor blueshifts under specific conditions. In addition, the 1D cloudy models indicate that clouds can slightly warm the upper atmosphere near apastron before dissipating at periastron, with TiO-induced thermal inversions emerging near periastron but showing limited impact at other phases.","The study interprets these findings as a demonstration of the critical interplay between orbital eccentricity and magnetic fields in governing atmospheric dynamics. The temperature-dependent magnetic drag, which becomes more pronounced on the hot, irradiated dayside, weakens the equatorial jet and alters the balance between radiative and advective processes. This results in marked phase-dependent thermal inversions and modified wind patterns that are observable in both high- and low-resolution emission spectra. The net Doppler shifts and variations in Doppler broadening in the spectra directly reflect the underlying wind dynamics, and the comparative timescales underscore how magnetic fields moderate the thermal and circulatory differences between apastron and periastron. Comparisons with previous work confirm that while prior models identified trends such as a narrowed jet and induced westward winds, the inclusion of kinematic MHD provides new insights into the modulation of these features by temperature-sensitive magnetic interactions.","The implications of this work are significant for both theoretical and observational exoplanetary science. By integrating temperature-dependent magnetic drag into 3D models, the study advances our ability to accurately predict the atmospheric circulation and emission characteristics of eccentric hot Jupiters. These predictions, particularly regarding phase-dependent temperature inversions, wind variability, and reduced Doppler broadening, offer clear observational targets for instruments like JWST and high-resolution spectrographs. If confirmed, such observations would not only validate the modeling approach but also enhance our understanding of magnetic field influences on exoplanet atmospheres, the process of orbital circularization, and the overall evolution of hot Jupiter systems. Future work exploring more complex magnetic field geometries and multidimensional cloud variations promises to further refine these insights and guide the design of subsequent observational campaigns."
2502.03929,pyEFPE: An improved post-Newtonian waveform model for inspiralling precessing‐eccentric compact binaries,Gonzalo Morras et al.,"Gravitational-wave signals from compact binary systems exhibit rich structure arising from spin-precession and orbital eccentricity, features that are essential for understanding the formation and evolution of these systems. Over the past years, multiple efforts have been made to capture these effects accurately in waveform models, yet challenges remain in mitigating numerical instabilities and incorporating higher-order post‐Newtonian (PN) corrections. Recent studies have also advanced effective-one-body formulations, surrogate models, and Bayesian inference tools, all aiming to improve the characterization of eccentric, spin-precessing binaries. Within this context, pyEFPE emerges as an innovative frequency-domain PN waveform model that integrates recent theoretical developments to offer robust and efficient gravitational-wave modeling for systems with nontrivial orbital dynamics.","The primary motivation behind the development of pyEFPE is the need for a waveform model that accurately captures the complexities of inspiralling compact binaries exhibiting both spin-precession and orbital eccentricity. Traditional models have often struggled to reconcile the rapid variation of orbital phases with the slower dynamics of spin precession, resulting in difficulties when modeling periastron advances and the effects of radiation reaction. In addition, efficient computation is crucial for data analysis pipelines that require the evaluation of millions of likelihoods during parameter estimation. By addressing these challenges with analytical Fourier mode amplitudes, careful treatment of PN corrections, and multiple scale analysis (MSA) for spin dynamics, pyEFPE targets both improved numerical stability and significant computational speedup—up to an estimated factor of \( \sim \mathcal{O}(20) \).","The pyEFPE model is constructed within a frequency-domain post‐Newtonian framework that starts at the Newtonian level using Keplerian parametrization. At Newtonian order, the binary’s eccentric orbit is described by
\[
r(u) = a (1 - e\cos u),
\]
\[
\ell = u - e \sin u,
\]
and the orbital phase is given by
\[
\phi_N = 2\arctan\!\left[\sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}\,\tan\frac{u}{2}\right].

Post‐Newtonian corrections introduce a periastron advance \( k \), modifying the orbital phase to

\phi = (1+k)v \approx (1+k)\ell + (v-\ell),
\]
with the periastron advance accumulating as \( \delta\lambda = k\ell \). The model also accounts for spin-precession effects by decomposing the gravitational-wave polarizations \( h_{+} \) and \( h_{\times} \) using spin‐weighted spherical harmonics and transforming into a co‐precessing frame. In this frame, the modes are expressed as
\[
H^{lm}(t) = h_0 e^{-im\phi(t)} K^{lm}[u(t)],
\]
with
\[
h_0 = 4\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{5}}\,\frac{M\nu}{d_L}(M\omega)^{2/3}.
\]
Reconstruction in the inertial frame is accomplished via Wigner \( D \)-matrices, which incorporate Euler angles \( \phi_z \), \( \theta_L \), and \( \zeta \).","Building upon these foundations, pyEFPE employs analytical expressions for Fourier mode amplitudes at Newtonian order using Bessel functions, for example,
\[
N_p^{20} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\,J_p(pe)
\]
for modes with \( m=0 \) and analogous expressions for \( m=2 \). Mode selection is performed by ordering Fourier modes according to their norm and selecting the minimal set required to reproduce the strain within a tolerance \( \epsilon_N \). The spin-precession dynamics themselves are modeled via multiple scale analysis (MSA); the spin-precession (SP) equations, including leading PN spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions, are solved analytically in a simplified frame aligned with the total angular momentum \( \boldsymbol{J} \). The solutions leverage Jacobi elliptic functions to express key variables such as the reduced aligned spin difference \( \delta \chi \) and incorporate analytical evaluations of Euler angle evolutions.","Radiation reaction (RR) is integrated by numerically solving the evolution equations for the PN parameter \( y \) and eccentricity \( e \), given by
\[
\mathcal{D} y = \nu\, y^{9}\left(a_{0} + \sum_{n=2}^{6} a_{n} y^{n}\right),
\]
\[
\mathcal{D} e^{2} = -\nu\, y^{8}\left(b_{0} + \sum_{n=2}^{6} b_{n} y^{n}\right),
\]
with adaptive Runge–Kutta methods used to ensure numerical accuracy. To further enhance computational efficiency, pyEFPE interpolates slowly varying Fourier mode amplitudes using Chebyshev nodes and cubic splines, and it modifies the Stationary Phase Approximation (SPA) through the Shifted Uniform Asymptotics (SUA) method to accurately compute frequency-domain waveforms.","# Results
Extensive testing and validation of pyEFPE have demonstrated its ability to accurately capture waveform phenomenology across a range of binary configurations. The model reproduces the complex behavior of gravitational-wave polarizations, including modulations induced by spin precession and bursts during periastron passages, with the computational advantages underscored by a speedup factor of roughly \( \sim \mathcal{O}(20) \). In high-eccentricity systems (e.g., \( e_0 = 0.7 \)), up to 40 Fourier modes are initially required, while the number decreases naturally as the binary circularizes. Comparisons against established quasi-circular models such as SpinTaylorT4, TaylorF2, and IMRPhenomXP show mismatches at very low levels (typically \( \lesssim 10^{-3} \) or lower), though certain regimes—especially at higher PN orders or extreme spin configurations—highlight areas for further improvements. Injection–recovery studies, including a precessing NSBH signal with \( m_1 = 10\,M_\odot \), \( m_2 = 1.6\,M_\odot \), and \( e_0 = 0.2 \) injected at 20 Hz, have confirmed that pyEFPE recovers intrinsic parameters with tight posterior distributions even for moderate signal-to-noise ratios (\( \approx 19.7 \)). Furthermore, the amplitude interpolation scheme reduces evaluation times from over 1 second for longer signals to as low as approximately 0.1 seconds for segments with \( T\leq32 \) seconds, making the model attractive for large-scale parameter estimation."
2502.04283,The Young Ages of \(70 \mu \mathrm{m}\),Kadin Worthen et al.,"The study is set in the context of understanding the enigmatic initial conditions of high-mass star formation (HMSF) in cold, dense molecular clouds. In these environments, \(70 \mu \mathrm{m}\)-dark clumps—commonly referred to as SMDCs—have emerged as ideal laboratories for probing the very earliest phases of HMSF. These clumps are characterized by their quiescent nature, with densities in the range of \(n(\mathrm{H}_2) \approx 10^3\)–\(10^5 \mathrm{cm}^{-3}\) and temperatures below \(20 \mathrm{K}\). Selected from dust continuum surveys and confirmed to have masses \(>400 \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\) and central densities of \(n(\mathrm{H}_2) \approx 10^4\)–\(10^5 \mathrm{cm}^{-3}\), the SMDCs are largely devoid of embedded protostars and other indicators of active star formation. As such, they present an excellent opportunity to assess conditions prior to significant stellar feedback and to explore chemical evolution in the absence of energetic internal heating.","A primary motivation of the study is to elucidate the early-stage chemistry and physical characteristics that precede efficient high-mass star formation. By focusing on carbon chain molecules such as \(\mathrm{HC}_{5} \mathrm{N}\), \(\mathrm{HC}_{7} \mathrm{N}\), and CCS, the investigation aims to determine whether the observed chemical signatures are indicative of young, dynamically evolving clumps. Such molecules, particularly the cyanopolyynes, are known to be prominent in early-time chemistry but fade as the environment evolves due to ion reactions and dust depletion. Thus, detecting robust emission from these species—combined with chemical age estimates below \(1 \, \mathrm{Myr}\)—could validate SMDCs as genuine initial conditions for HMSF rather than as inefficient sites for star formation.","Observations were carried out using the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in D configuration with the WIDAR correlator, targeting 12 SMDCs in the K-band (18–26.5 GHz). The synthesized beam was approximately \(\theta_{\text{syn}} \approx 33^{\prime\prime}.4\) with a field of view of 2.6 arcmin, and spectral resolutions ranged from \(0.16\) to \(0.42 \, \mathrm{km \, s}^{-1}\). Carbon chain molecules were imaged using CASA’s “multiscale” deconvolver, although low per-channel signal-to-noise often necessitated spectral stacking, particularly for \(\mathrm{HC}_{7} \mathrm{N}\). Extraction of the carbon chain spectra from the VLA data cubes relied on a combination of masking techniques—using \(\mathrm{NH}_3(1,1)\) moment 0 maps as templates—and velocity registration aligned with \(\mathrm{NH}_3(1,1)\) moment 1 maps to account for turbulent clump kinematics. Integrated fluxes were determined via pixel summation above a \(3\sigma\) brightness threshold (approximately \(0.015 \, \mathrm{Jy \, bm}^{-1} \, \mathrm{km \, s}^{-1}\)), and both Gaussian fitting and analysis of line-free regions were used to estimate uncertainties. Column densities were calculated assuming optically thin conditions and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) with rotational partition functions and adopted excitation temperatures of 4–6 K (typically 5 K). Additionally, gas masses were derived using the expression  
\[
M_{\mathrm{gas}} = \frac{d^2 F_{\nu} R}{B_{\nu}(T) \kappa_{\nu}},
\]  
with \(\kappa_{\nu} = 1.85 \, \mathrm{cm}^{2} \, \mathrm{g}^{-1}\) and temperature \(T\) determined from \(\mathrm{NH}_3\) observations. This methodology ensured spatial consistency in comparing carbon chain spectra with dust continuum and \(\mathrm{H}_2\) column density maps.","The observations yielded detections of \(\mathrm{HC}_{5} \mathrm{N}\) and CCS in 11 out of 12 clumps, with only one clump (G23605) showing a non-detection. Though \(\mathrm{HC}_{7} \mathrm{N}\) was not detected in individual spectra, spectral stacking of 11 sources reduced the noise by a factor of five, resulting in robust detections of this molecule. The brightest lines of \(\mathrm{HC}_{5} \mathrm{N}\) and CCS were observed in sources G30912 and G28565, respectively, while the faintest emissions came from clumps such as G30120 and G30660. Column densities and abundances were computed from the extracted spectra, and a notable positive correlation (\(r = 0.70\)) was found between CCS and \(\mathrm{HC}_{5} \mathrm{N}\) column densities. Comparative analysis with UMIST dark cloud chemistry models—especially using a median clump density of \(n(\mathrm{H}_2)=2 \times 10^4 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-3}\)—suggested that the observed \(\mathrm{HC}_{5} \mathrm{N}\) and \(\mathrm{HC}_{7} \mathrm{N}\) abundances correspond to chemical ages less than \(1 \, \mathrm{Myr}\), with some estimates indicating ages below \(0.5 \, \mathrm{Myr}\). The derived gas masses and densities confirmed that the clumps have sufficient material (\(>790 \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\)) for high-mass star formation, while virial parameters around \(\alpha \sim 0.7\) imply that they are gravitationally bound.","The robust detections of carbon chain molecules in these SMDCs, coupled with their derived abundances and column density correlations, support the interpretation that these clumps are chemically young and representative of the earliest stages of high-mass star formation. The consistency between the chemical age estimates from \(\mathrm{HC}_{5} \mathrm{N}\) and the stacked \(\mathrm{HC}_{7} \mathrm{N}\) observations reinforces the argument that the clumps have not reached chemical equilibrium. Furthermore, the observed absence of warm carbon chain chemistry processes—evidenced by narrow line widths (\(\sim 1\)–\(2 \, \mathrm{km/s}\)) and lack of high-temperature (\(T > 25 \, \mathrm{K}\)) or high-density (\(n(\mathrm{H}_2) \sim 7 \times 10^5 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-3}\)) signatures—indicates that the detected carbon chains originate from the cold, quiescent initial conditions rather than from localized protostellar heating or outflow-driven shock chemistry. This interpretation is bolstered by the alignment of the measured free-fall timescale, \(t_{\mathrm{ff}} \approx 4.4 \times 10^5\) years, with the chemical age estimates, suggesting that the clumps are not only chemically young but also dynamically evolving.","The implications of this research are significant for our understanding of high-mass star formation. The confirmation that SMDCs possess both the mass and the density to support eventual high-mass star formation, along with clear indications of their early chemical state, demonstrates that these clumps are indeed viable precursors to high-mass stars. The study’s findings imply that even in the absence of active protostellar feedback, early-time carbon chain chemistry can serve as a reliable diagnostic of the initial conditions in star-forming regions. Additionally, the sensitivity of the molecular abundances to density and the successful application of chemical models underscore the potential of using carbon chain species as tracers for the age and evolutionary status of dense cores. This work paves the way for further investigations into the role of magnetic fields, turbulence, and chemical reaction uncertainties in regulating the collapse and subsequent star formation processes in similar environments."
2502.03704,Electron-induced \(\mathrm{CO}\),Sankhabrata Chandra et al.,"Europa’s surface and exosphere have long captured scientific interest due to the presence of \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) in its chaotic terrains and extended atmosphere. Similar detections of \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) on other icy bodies like Ganymede, Enceladus, and Titan underline the importance of understanding its origin. While debates persist over whether \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) is produced endogenically, possibly linked to young surface features, or exogenically via radiolysis and sputtering of complex organic molecules (COMs), observations suggest that both hydrocarbons and their functionalized forms (including alcohols and acids) exist throughout the Solar System. These organic species may undergo energetic processing through radiolysis, influencing the volatile inventory and chemical evolution of icy surfaces.","The uncertainty surrounding the origin of \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) on Europa drives the exploration of alternative production mechanisms. This study is motivated by the need to discern whether electron-induced sputtering of organic molecules in water ice, particularly COMs bearing different functional groups, can efficiently generate \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\). By investigating the role of functionalization—contrasting non-functionalized hydrocarbons with alcohol- and acid-functionalized molecules—the research aims to shed light on the chemical pathways that might account for the observed \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) and provide insights into surface-exosphere interactions on icy bodies.","Experiments were conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Ice Spectroscopy Laboratory using a stainless-steel vacuum chamber maintained at pressures below \(10^{-8}\) mbar. A closed-cycle helium cryostat provided precise temperature control at 80 K, 100 K, and 120 K, mirroring the conditions on icy planetary bodies. Ice samples were prepared via vapor deposition for volatile mixtures such as \(\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}\):hexane and by spray deposition using a homemade nebulizer for less volatile compounds like \(\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}\):hexanoic acid and \(\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}\):hexanol. Sputtering was initiated with a 2 keV electron beam at a 5 µA current applied for 120 minutes, which delivered an energy flux of \(1.1 \times 10^{13}\) keV cm\(^{-2}\) s\(^{-1}\) — equivalent to approximately 360 hours of irradiation on Europa. Complementary temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments further elucidated how volatile products, such as \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) and hydrocarbon fragments, were released. Control experiments confirmed that the mass spectrometer’s identification of \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) at \(\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{z}=44\) was robust and that ambient contributions during deposition were minimal and consistent across techniques.","The experiments revealed that acid-functionalized molecules produce significantly more \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) than their non- or alcohol-functionalized counterparts. Acidic compounds, specifically hexanoic acid, induced over ten times greater \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) production compared to other functional groups, with outputs peaking in the temperature range from 100 K to 120 K. In quantitative terms, hexanoic acid ice sputtered 78% more \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) than pure water ice at 100 K, whereas hexanol ice yielded only a 24% increase. Additionally, initial \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) production in acid-functionalized ices was roughly 100 times greater than in non-functionalized cases. Hydrocarbon fragments, indicated by \(\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{z}=15\) (attributed to \(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\)), exhibited higher intensities in acid-rich environments, and sputtering of long-chain molecules like pentane was found to be nearly 100 times greater in hexanoic acid ice compared to hexanol ice. Temperature dependence was evident as sputtering yields increased with temperature, and TPD experiments detailed that much of the \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) was trapped at lower temperatures (80 K) but released during warming, with hexanoic acid showing up to 97% release at 120 K versus only 36% at 80 K.","The heightened \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) production observed in hexanoic acid ice is interpreted as a direct consequence of the carboxylic acid functional group’s ability to facilitate rapid bond cleavage. In hexanoic acid, the cleavage of the \(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{COOH}\) bond leads to the efficient release of volatile \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) and shorter carbon chains like pentane, in contrast to hexanol, where the cleavage at the \(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{OH}\) bond necessitates oxidation and results in comparatively lower yields. The distinct temperature-dependent behaviors observed through TPD experiments further emphasize that molecular volatility and bond energies are critical in determining the sputtering outcomes. These findings suggest that even subtle differences in molecular structure can have profound impacts on the chemistry induced by radiation on icy surfaces.","The implications of this study are significant for our broader understanding of icy bodies in the Solar System. The observation that functional groups, particularly carboxylic acids, dramatically enhance \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) and volatile hydrocarbon production under electron irradiation implies that radiolysis could be a viable mechanism for explaining the \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) observed on Europa and elsewhere. Furthermore, the findings indicate that as organic molecules lose their carboxylic acid group through bond cleavage, their potential detectability as biosignatures may diminish, thus influencing strategies for future planetary exploration. Overall, this work underscores the pivotal role of temperature and molecular structure in governing radiation-induced surface and exospheric chemistry, with broader consequences for understanding the evolution of planetary surfaces and the potential habitability of icy worlds."
2502.04059,Fundamental Oscillations of Massive Boson Stars and Distinguishability,L.S. et al.,"Dark matter (DM) constitutes approximately 25% of the universe's energy budget, yet its particle nature remains elusive despite numerous experimental searches for candidates such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). The discovery of the Higgs boson and predictions of scalar particles—such as axions and axion-like particles (ALPs)—have shifted the focus towards light bosonic DM candidates, including fuzzy dark matter. In this context, boson stars (BSs), which are self-gravitating configurations of bosonic particles, have emerged as potential exotic compact objects (ECOs) capable of mimicking black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs). Gravitational wave (GW) observations provide a novel probe to investigate these non-accreting BSs, complementing traditional electromagnetic methods.","The study is driven by the need to understand the properties and oscillation characteristics of massive boson stars in the strong-interaction regime and to assess their potential role as dark matter constituents. Given that boson stars may significantly contribute to the dark matter budget and could be confused with conventional compact objects like BHs and NSs, it becomes imperative to identify distinct signatures. In particular, the oscillatory \(f\)-modes—characteristic oscillations of perturbations in stellar models—offer a promising observable for distinguishing BSs from other compact objects. The motivation is further reinforced by the opportunity to utilize scaling relations in the strong-interaction limit, which could allow for a universal description of \(f\)-mode properties across the scalar dark matter parameter space.","Massive boson stars are modeled using a self-interacting scalar field with a potential given by 
\[
V(\phi)=\frac{1}{2} m^{2}|\phi|^{2}+\frac{1}{4} \lambda|\phi|^{4},
\]
where \(m\) represents the dark matter particle mass and \(\lambda\) is the self-interaction parameter. In the strong interaction limit, defined by \(\Lambda \equiv \frac{\lambda M_{Pl}^{2}}{4 \pi m^{2}} \gg 1\), the BS configurations mimic degenerate fermionic stars with the maximum mass scaling as 
\[
M_{\max} \propto \frac{\sqrt{\lambda} M_{Pl}^{3}}{m^{2}}.
\]
The effective equation of state in this regime is described by 
\[
p=\frac{m^{4}}{9\lambda}\left(\sqrt{1+\frac{3\lambda}{m^{4}}\rho}-1\right)^{2}.
\]
The study employs scaling relations for mass, radius, and \(f\)-mode oscillations. In particular, the \(f\)-mode frequency \(f\) and damping time \(\tau\) are seen to scale as 
\[
f \propto \frac{1}{x M_{Pl}}, \quad \tau \propto x M_{Pl},
\]
with the parameter \(x\equiv\frac{\sqrt{\lambda}}{m^{2}}\). By defining the scaled frequency \(f'=f(xM_{Pl})\) and damping time \(\tau'=\tau/(xM_{Pl})\), the formalism achieves a description that is independent of the dark matter parameters. Both full general relativistic treatments and approximations such as the Cowling formalism are utilized. In the Cowling approximation, metric perturbations are neglected, and the scaling invariance is demonstrated through the transformation of perturbation functions and boundary conditions. The full general relativity framework further couples metric perturbations with matter through functions like \(H\), \(H_1\), and \(K\), while incorporating the Zerilli equation 
\[
\frac{d^{2} Z}{d r_{*}^{2}}+\omega^{2} Z=V_{Z}Z,
\]
to handle perturbations outside the star and to ultimately solve for complex quasinormal mode frequencies via the condition \(A(\omega)=0\).","The analysis reveals that in the strong interaction limit, massive boson stars exhibit universal scaling relations for the \(f\)-mode oscillations. Specifically, it is found that the scaled \(f\)-mode properties, \(f'\) and \(\tau'\), are independent of the specific values of \(\lambda\) and \(m\). For the most compact boson star configuration, characterized by a compactness \(C'=0.16\), the maximum scaled frequency is determined to be \(f'_{\max}=0.21\) and the minimum scaled damping time is \(\tau'_{\min}=1900\). Consequently, the number of oscillations, given by the product \(N=f\tau=f'\tau'\), attains a minimum of \(N_{\min}=406\) oscillations at maximum compactness. Additionally, the paper derives explicit expressions for the \(f\)-mode frequency of boson stars compared with black holes, such as 
\[
f_{BS}=202.67 f'(C) M'(C) \left(\frac{M_{\odot}}{M_{BS}}\right) \, \text{kHz},
\]
and shows that for maximum compactness, 
\[
f_{BS,\max}=2.67 \left(\frac{M_{\odot}}{M_{BS}}\right) \, \text{kHz}.
\]
The analysis also indicates that while neutron stars and boson stars have overlapping ranges of compactness, black holes, with \(C=0.5\), produce consistently higher \(f\)-mode frequencies. The ratio 
\[
\mathcal{R}_{BS/BH}=\frac{f_{BS,\max}}{f_{BH}}=0.22,
\]
implies that black hole frequencies exceed those of boson stars by roughly a factor of 4.5. Additional derivations show how the \(f\)-mode to ISCO frequency ratio for boson stars reaches values as high as 6.79 at maximum compactness, which is considerably higher than those for neutron stars and black holes. Detailed analytical fits and numerical integrations in both the Cowling approximation and the full general relativistic formulation corroborate these scaling relations, reinforcing the universality of the results.","The derived scaling relations and oscillation properties provide clear, quantitative signatures that can be used to distinguish boson stars from neutron stars and black holes. The independence of the scaled \(f\)-mode characteristics from the specific dark matter parameters \(\lambda\) and \(m\) establishes a universal framework applicable across a wide range of the scalar DM parameter space. The lower \(f\)-mode frequencies of boson stars when compared to black holes, as well as the dependence of the \(f_{BS}/f_{BS}^{ISCO}\) ratio on compactness, emphasize the unique vibrational behavior of these objects. The work demonstrates that gravitational wave observations, through the measurement of \(f\)-mode oscillations and the number of oscillations prior to damping, have the potential to identify boson stars and thus provide insights into the nature of dark matter and the properties of scalar field configurations in strong gravitational fields.","The results of this study hold significant implications for both astrophysics and fundamental physics. The ability to use \(f\)-mode oscillations as a distinguishing feature opens up a promising avenue for gravitational wave astronomy to detect and confirm the existence of boson stars, thereby offering a new method to probe the dark matter sector. Furthermore, the universal scaling relations eliminate the need for separate studies for every parameter set, providing a robust framework for future analyses. The findings suggest that future work could extend these analyses to explore higher compactness scenarios with alternative potentials (such as \(\phi^n\) with \(n>4\)) and to incorporate the effects of rotation in boson stars. Ultimately, this line of investigation has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of compact objects, contribute to the identification of dark matter candidates, and enrich the interpretation of gravitational wave signals from exotic astrophysical sources."
2502.04068,Fundamental Oscillations of Massive Boson Stars – II,First Author et al.,"Boson Stars (BSs) are self-gravitating configurations of complex scalar fields that have been proposed as potential contributors to dark matter. These objects are formed when a massive scalar field, governed by a potential of the form  
\[
V(\phi)=\frac{1}{2}m^{2}|\phi|^{2}+\frac{1}{4}\lambda|\phi|^{4},
\]  
self-interacts and gravitationally equilibrates. In the regime where the interaction is strong, characterized by \(\lambda \gg m^2/M_{Pl}^2\) and more precisely by the condition \(\Lambda=\frac{\lambda M_{Pl}^2}{4\pi m^2}\gg 1\) (with \(\Lambda>1000\) marking the strong-interaction limit), BSs begin to resemble fermionic stars. This background establishes the context of utilizing these exotic compact objects not only as viable dark matter candidates but also as unique laboratories for studying fundamental oscillations and gravitational wave (GW) emissions.","The study is driven by the need to understand the fundamental non-radial oscillations, particularly the \(f\)-modes, of massive Boson Stars and their potential as GW sources. With the possibility of BSs contributing to dark matter, investigating their oscillatory behavior provides insights that could distinguish them from neutron stars (NSs) and other compact objects. Additionally, by mapping the parameter space in the \(\lambda\)-\(m\) plane and determining the scaling relations, the work aims to identify regions where the oscillations and associated GW signals are strong enough to be detectable by instruments such as LISA, LIGO, NEMO, CE, and ET. This approach is motivated by both the theoretical challenge of modeling such exotic systems and the observational promise of using GW asteroseismology as a probe of dark matter and compact object physics.","The investigation models self-interacting bosonic dark matter using scalar fields with a quartic potential  
\[
V(|\phi|)=\frac{1}{2}m^{2}|\phi|^{2}+\frac{1}{4}\lambda|\phi|^{4},
\]  
which naturally gives rise to massive BSs when the parameter \(\Lambda=\frac{\lambda M_{Pl}^2}{4\pi m^2}\) is significantly larger than one. In this strong-interaction limit, the BS system mimics a perfect fluid described by an equation of state such as \(p^{\prime}=\frac{1}{9}(\sqrt{1+3\rho^{\prime}}-1)^{2}\). The methodology includes deriving analytical relations for static observables—for example, identifying scaled mass \(M'\), radius \(R'\), and compactness \(C\) relations—and extending the analysis to the fundamental \(l=2\) quasinormal modes (or \(f\)-modes) by employing scaling relations. These oscillation modes are characterized by scaled frequencies and damping times, expressed as \(f=f'/\,(x\,M_{Pl})\) and \(\tau=\tau'(x\,M_{Pl})\) with the scaling variable \(x=\sqrt{\lambda}/m^2\). The study also explores the parameter space delineated by constraints from CMB/LSS data, dwarf galaxy observations, and self-interaction cross-section bounds, along with detailed fits for mass-radius curves, tidal deformabilities, and moment of inertia (including universal \(I\)-Love-\(Q\) relations).","The paper presents a comprehensive set of analytical fits and scaled relations that describe both the static properties and the oscillatory behavior of massive BSs. For static observables, mass-radius relations yield a maximum scaled mass of \(M_{\max}^{\prime}=0.06\) and a maximum compactness \(C_{\max}=0.16\), with the radius saturating to \(R_{\max}^{\prime}=0.625\) at low masses. These relations are captured by quadratic and quartic fits with accuracies within \(2\%\) and \(0.25\%\) respectively. In the oscillation analysis, the \(f\)-mode frequency and damping time are scaled as \(f' = f\,x\,M_{Pl}\) and \(\tau' = \tau/(x\,M_{Pl})\), with the \(f'\)-mass relation well described by a hyperbola reaching \(f_{\max}^{\prime}=0.21\) at the maximum mass. Additional fits relating \(f'\) to compactness (accurate to within \(1\%\) for \(C \gtrsim 0.02\)) and a damping time that decreases with increasing mass and compactness (attaining \(\tau_{\min}^{\prime}=1900\)) are presented. Universal relations emerge in the form of an \(f\)-Love-\(C\) connection, where the \(f\)-mode frequency scales with \(\sqrt{M/R^3}\) according to fits like  
\[
f(\mathrm{kHz})=a+b\sqrt{GM/R^3},
\]  
with \(a=-0.0045\) and \(b=0.21\). Furthermore, the analysis maps the detectability of these modes against the sensitivity bands of GW detectors, setting thresholds on the parameter \(x\) and providing detailed estimates for GW signal-to-noise ratios and damping times, all of which support the possibility of observing BS \(f\)-modes in various regions of the scalar dark matter parameter space.","The derived scaling relations and analytical fits underscore that massive BSs in the strong-interaction limit not only mirror the properties of fermionic stars but also exhibit distinct oscillatory signatures that set them apart from NSs. The universal relations—whether for the static observables such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability or for dynamic quantities like \(f\)-mode frequency and damping time—reveal dependencies that are largely independent of the model parameters \(m\) and \(\lambda\). This independence enhances the predictability of BS properties and implies that measurements of GW signals could directly infer the fundamental characteristics of these objects. In particular, the way \(f\)-mode frequencies scale with \(\sqrt{M/R^3}\) combined with the unique \(I\)-Love-\(Q\) relations offers a robust framework for distinguishing BSs from NSs in future GW asteroseismology studies.","The implications of this work are multifold. By establishing precise analytical fits and universal relations, the study lays a solid groundwork for using GW observations to probe the properties of BSs and, by extension, aspects of dark matter physics. The detectability analysis suggests that current and next-generation GW detectors—such as LISA, aLIGO, NEMO, CE, and ET—could potentially identify \(f\)-mode signals from BSs, particularly in regions of the parameter space where BS masses span from stellar to galactic scales. Moreover, the discussion of future scopes, including extensions to other interaction potentials and contributions to stochastic GW backgrounds, signals an exciting avenue for research into exotic compact objects. These findings not only enhance our understanding of BSs in the context of gravitational asteroseismology but also offer promising strategies for testing dark matter models through astrophysical observations."
2502.04016,From Planetesimals to Dwarf Planets by Pebble Accretion,Chris W. Ormel et al.,"The Kuiper Belt comprises a dynamically cold population that formed in situ at approximately \(45\) au and a dynamically hot population that likely originated closer to the Sun (around \(20\) au) before being implanted during periods of giant planet migration. Cold trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are characterized by low orbital inclinations, redder colors, and high binary fractions, whereas hot TNOs exhibit higher inclinations, more neutral colors, and include more massive bodies such as dwarf planets. Observational surveys, including OSSOS and DEEP, have revealed that although both populations share similar size distributions at lower masses (approximately \(H_{r} \gtrsim 5\)), the high-mass end of the hot population shows a notable flattening. This similarity at low masses is consistent with the outcomes expected from streaming instability, while the difference at high masses indicates an additional growth mechanism at work.","The study is driven by the need to explain the distinctive features observed in the TNO size distributions, particularly the presence of massive bodies in the dynamically hot population. The motivation is to address how pebble accretion, a process sensitive to parameters such as particle stopping time (\(\tau_{s}\)) and relative velocity (\(\Delta v\)), might be responsible for the efficient growth of these bodies, thereby shaping the high-mass end of the TNO distribution. Given that pebble accretion could operate in a gas-rich disk prior to the dynamical instability that implanted these bodies into the trans-Neptunian region, the research seeks to quantify the key parameters and test the feasibility of this mechanism in explaining how the observed mass distributions evolved.","The study employs a detailed modeling approach that reconstructs the present-day mass distribution of dynamically hot TNOs within 48 au using data from the Minor Planet Center (MPC) and debiased distributions from the OSSOS++ survey. The mass distribution is described using a broken power law for dimmer TNOs (with \(H_{r} > 5\)) and an exponentially tapered power law for the cold belt. In order to simulate the growth of bodies by pebble accretion, the authors consider rates dependent on the accretion of pebbles with a dimensionless stopping time \(\tau_{s}\) and relative velocities influenced by gravitational focusing factors \(\left(v_{\text{esc}}/\Delta v\right)^2\). The accretion process is modeled by the equation 
\[
\frac{dq}{dt} = A_{\text{peb}} \frac{q \tau_{s}}{t_{0}} f_{\text{set}}^{2},
\]
where \(f_{\text{set}}\) incorporates the effects of turbulence and relative motion. A comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis is performed to fit the simulated distributions to the observed data. The model parameters include the initial mass distribution break \(m_{\text{brk}}\), the primordial belt mass \(m_{\text{imf}}\), and pebble properties such as the dimensionless velocity \(\sigma\), stopping time \(\tau_s\), and the total mass of accreted pebbles \(m_{\text{Peb}}\). The model also accounts for a binary switch distinguishing laminar from turbulent velocity fields and integrates ordinary differential equations until the pebble reservoir is depleted, with the quality of the fit evaluated using both Gaussian and binomial statistical methods.","The MCMC analysis reveals distinct posterior parameter values across four model suites, including both laminar and turbulent velocity field scenarios and configurations with either a single or dual pebble size component. In the laminar single-pebble model, a strong correlation is observed between the stopping time \(\tau_{s}\) and the relative velocity, with pebble accretion becoming dominant above a characteristic mass scale of \(m_{*} \approx 10^{-5} m_{\oplus}\). For masses above \(m_{*}\), the accretion process efficiently flattens the high-mass tail of the TNO distribution, whereas at much lower masses the initial mass function is preserved. Additionally, turbulent models offer marginal improvements in fitting the data but require low values of \(\tau_{s}\) that imply accretion timescales incompatible with the lifetime of gas-rich disks. Simulated scenarios suggest that between 5 and \(8\, m_{\oplus}\) (and up to around \(10\, m_{\oplus}\) in some cases) of pebbles can be accreted. Notably, models tend to overshoot the observed distribution near \(m = 10^{-4} m_{\oplus}\) and undershoot it around \(m = 3 \times 10^{-3} m_{\oplus}\), reflecting the statistical uncertainties inherent in the sparse sampling of high-mass TNOs. Examination of an additional, secondary pebble component does not substantially improve the model fits, as indicated by Bayes factors of 0.54 for laminar and 0.18 for turbulent cases.","The results indicate that pebble accretion is likely the dominant mechanism responsible for the growth of massive TNOs, with the process becoming effective above a threshold mass of approximately \(10^{22}\) g. The derived parameter values (\(\tau_s \sim 10^{-2}\) and effective accretion timescales on the order of 0.1–1 Myr) support the view that pebble accretion was efficient in a gas-rich disk environment, particularly within pressure maxima reminiscent of ALMA-observed pebble rings. In contrast, models assuming a laminar disk with a global pressure gradient yield inferior fits, primarily due to slow drift speeds and overly high pebble mass requirements. The clear flattening at the high-mass end of the TNO size distribution is interpreted as a signature of the rapid growth induced by pebble accretion, while the low-mass end retains the imprint of the initial mass function established by streaming instability and planetesimal formation processes.","The findings have significant implications for our understanding of solar system formation and the origin of dwarf planets. The study suggests that high-mass TNOs, some of which meet the International Astronomical Union's criteria for dwarf planets based on their spherical shapes and inability to clear their orbits, likely grew through pebble accretion within narrow, turbulence-driven rings. This mode of growth not only explains the observed flattening in the TNO size distribution but also indicates that traditional planetesimal accretion may have played a secondary role, particularly in the formation of smaller bodies. Future observations, including occultation studies and surveys by projects such as CLASSY and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, are expected to refine these models further. These advances will help distinguish between the competing growth mechanisms and contribute to a more comprehensive theory on how the early solar system evolved into the structure we observe today."
2502.03705,Dependence of Multi－band Absolute Magnitudes and Color Indexes of the Tip of Red Giant Branch Stars on Metallicity in the Galactic Globular Clusters,Zhishuai Ge et al.,"The study focuses on the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) stars, which are pivotal in distance calibrations and determining the Hubble constant \(H_0\). These stars are located at the top of the red giant branch in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and have been widely used as a standard candle due to their nearly constant \(I\)-band absolute magnitude \(M_{\mathrm{I}}\) in metal-poor regimes. While theoretical models predict that TRGB luminosities are affected by metallicity—with the \(I\)-band remaining almost independent and other optical and infrared bands exhibiting systematic trends—the literature has shown discrepancies between observational studies and theoretical predictions. This work leverages data primarily from Gaia DR3, along with photometry from 2MASS and OGLE, to analyze TRGB stars in Galactic globular clusters and thereby refine the calibration of their luminosities and colors across various bands.","The motivation for this study arises from the ongoing tension in \(H_0\) measurements, where differences between determinations from SNe Ia and those derived from the cosmic microwave background call for reliable, independent distance calibrators. TRGB stars, as an alternative to Cepheid variables, offer an independent method for measuring distances with important implications for cosmology. Discrepancies in previous TRGB calibrations—especially in the \(I\)-band where metallicity is thought to have minimal impact—necessitate a detailed reexamination of the metallicity dependence of multi-band absolute magnitudes and color indexes in TRGB stars. By resolving these discrepancies, the study aims to improve the precision of \(H_0\) determinations.","The analysis was conducted by selecting 43 Galactic globular clusters covering a uniform metallicity range (from \(-2.5\) to \(-0.5\)), as compiled by Vasiliev and Baumgardt (2021), and later narrowing the sample to 33 clusters with more than 1000 stars and confirmed single color-magnitude diagram (CMD) populations. TRGB candidates were identified by focusing on the reddest stars in the CMDs, with special attention paid to exclude asymptotic giant branch stars and long-period variables that showed photometric dispersions greater than 0.05 mag. The study crossmatched optical photometric data in \(G_{\mathrm{BP}}, G_{\mathrm{RP}}, V,\) and \(I\) bands with near-infrared data in \(J, H,\) and \(K_{\mathrm{S}}\) bands from 2MASS and OGLE surveys. Absolute magnitudes were calculated using Gaia parallax information and historical distance measurements, while corrections were applied for extinction and uncertainties due to opacity effects, particularly in metal-rich clusters.","The absolute magnitudes in various bands were calculated, revealing that the \(I\)-band magnitude \(M_{\mathrm{I}}\) remains nearly constant at \(-4.017 \pm 0.036 \pm 0.027\) mag for clusters with \([\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}] < -1.2\). However, at higher metallicities, \(M_{\mathrm{I}}\) becomes fainter, a trend that may lead to an increase in the inferred value of \(H_0\). In short-wavelength optical bands such as \(G_{\mathrm{BP}}\) and \(V\), the absolute magnitudes exhibit a significant power-law dependence on metallicity, while in near-infrared bands like \(J\), \(H\), and \(K_{\mathrm{S}}\) a linear inverse trend is observed. Analytical relations were derived via least-squares fitting. For instance, the relations include
\[
\begin{gathered}
M_{G_{\mathrm{BP}}} = 7.28 \times \exp (2.19 \times [\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]) - 2.40, \\
M_{G_{\mathrm{RP}}} = 0.13 \times [\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}] - 3.66, \\
M_{V} = 11.29 \times \exp (2.76 \times [\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]) - 2.62, \\
M_{I} = 10.47 \times \exp (3.92 \times [\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]) - 4.017, \\
M_{J} = -0.07 \times [\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}] - 5.18, \\
M_{K_{\mathrm{S}}} = -0.34 \times [\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}] - 6.55.
\end{gathered}
\]
Color indexes such as \((G_{\mathrm{BP}}-G_{\mathrm{RP}}, V-I, J-K_{\mathrm{S}})\) exhibit smaller dispersions relative to the magnitudes. Furthermore, a comprehensive uncertainty analysis factoring in errors from distance, color excess, and photometry yielded a mean observational error of 0.027 mag in the \(I\)-band and additional systematic uncertainty of 0.029 mag. The study finds that for \([\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}] < -1.2\) the derived value of \(H_{0}\) is \(70.86 \pm 1.2 \pm 0.9\) km/s/Mpc, while for higher metallicities the intrinsic faintness of \(M_{\mathrm{I}}\) could lead to a modest rise in \(H_0\).","The results confirm that metallicity plays a significant role in influencing TRGB luminosity. For metal-poor clusters (\([\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}] < -1.2\)), the constant \(I\)-band magnitude supports the longstanding notion of near-metallicity independence in this band. However, for higher metallicities, the fainter \(M_{\mathrm{I}}\) values indicate a clear metallicity dependence, aligning with theoretical predictions related to increased opacity and shifts in black-body radiation at different wavelengths. The derived relations illustrate that while optical bands are more sensitive to metallicity variations, near-infrared bands exhibit trends that are more linear. Additionally, the reduced dispersion in color indexes underscores their potential as more stable calibrators compared to absolute magnitudes. The presence of circumstellar dust in certain metal-rich TRGB stars further suggests that additional factors—such as effective temperature reductions and dust absorption—may modulate the observed luminosities.","These findings have important implications for the calibration of cosmic distance scales and the accurate determination of the Hubble constant. The result that \(M_{\mathrm{I}}\) remains nearly universal in metal-poor environments, yet becomes fainter in metal-rich systems, emphasizes the need to account for metallicity corrections when using TRGB stars as standard candles. Such calibrations will improve the precision of \(H_0\) estimates and help reconcile differences among various cosmological measurements. Furthermore, the clear delineation of metallicity dependencies across multiple bands reinforces the necessity for future studies to consider wavelength-dependent effects and potential dust contamination when analyzing TRGB stars in different galactic environments."
2502.04154,Searching for Internal Absorption Signatures in High-Redshift Blazars,A. Dmytriiev et al.,"Blazars, a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with jets aligned toward Earth, exhibit a characteristic two-bump spectral energy distribution (SED). The lower-energy component is typically attributed to synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons, while the origin of the higher-energy bump is debated. Leptonic models generally invoke inverse Compton (IC) scattering, either through synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) processes or external inverse Compton (EIC) mechanisms involving ambient photon fields from the accretion disk, broad-line region (BLR), or dusty torus. Alternatively, hadronic models propose that proton-photon interactions or even proton synchrotron emission may be responsible. In Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), which are typically EIC-dominated, the high-energy emission region remains uncertain and may be located either within or beyond the BLR. In addition to producing the observed emission, the ambient photon fields also attenuate \(\gamma\)-rays via internal \(\gamma-\gamma\) absorption, imprinting spectral features that are critical for understanding the structure of FSRQs and determining the precise location of the \(\gamma\)-ray emitting region.","The study is motivated by the desire to probe and constrain the location of the \(\gamma\)-ray emission region within high-redshift FSRQs by searching for signatures of internal \(\gamma-\gamma\) absorption. Since the BLR photon field, dominated by lines such as Ly \(\alpha\), C IV, Mg II, and H \(\beta\), can significantly attenuate \(\gamma\)-rays, detecting these absorption features provides direct insights into both the density and the structure of the BLR and the relative position of the emission site with respect to the SMBH. High-redshift sources are particularly attractive because cosmological redshift shifts key absorption features, such as those expected around \(\sim 25\, \mathrm{GeV}/(1+z)\) for Ly \(\alpha\) absorption, to lower and more observable energies, thereby enhancing the detectability of these subtle spectral imprints.","The investigation leverages Fermi-LAT data spanning from MJD 54683 to MJD 59794 (August 4, 2008, to August 4, 2022) for nine high-redshift \((z \gtrsim 3)\) FSRQs, as originally selected by Paliya et al. (2020). Photons in the energy range from 100 MeV to 300 GeV were extracted within a \(15^{\circ}\) region of interest (RoI), with zenith angle restrictions (\(90^{\circ}\)) employed to minimize contamination from the Earth limb. The analysis incorporated background models such as isotropic and Galactic diffuse templates along with 4FGL-DR4 source parameters. For the internal \(\gamma-\gamma\) absorption modeling, the BLR is assumed to dominate, and the photon field is constructed by combining major emission lines and a blackbody continuum at \(T = 1500\, \mathrm{K}\). The BLR is approximated as a shell with inner and outer radii \(R_1=0.9\, R_{\mathrm{BLR}}\) and \(R_2=1.1\, R_{\mathrm{BLR}}\), respectively, with a BLR size estimated using the relation  
\[
R_{\mathrm{BLR}} \simeq 0.1 \left(L_{\mathrm{D},46}\right)^{1/2}\, \mathrm{pc},
\]  
where \(L_{\mathrm{D},46}\) is the disk luminosity in units of \(10^{46}\) erg s\(^{-1}\). The model further assumes a BLR luminosity fraction \(\xi_{\mathrm{BLR}} = 20\%\) of \(L_\mathrm{D}\) to ensure consistency with the observed line strengths. The \(\gamma-\gamma\) optical depth \(\tau_{\gamma-\gamma}\) is then computed as a function of the \(\gamma\)-ray energy \(E_{\gamma}\) and the distance \(d\) from the SMBH, with the attenuation factor expressed as \(\exp(-\tau_{\gamma-\gamma})\). A binned likelihood analysis is performed using FERMIPY (v1.0.1) and the Fermi Science Tools (version 11-05-03) to extract spectral energy distributions (SEDs), where the intrinsic spectrum is modeled using either a power law (PL), log-parabola (LP), or a power law with an exponential cutoff (PLEC). The complete spectral model also includes extragalactic background light (EBL) absorption following the prescriptions of Saldana-Lopez et al. (2021), resulting in the composite model  
\[
\frac{dN}{dE} = \frac{dN_{\text{intrinsic}}}{dE} \times \exp\left(-\tau_{\gamma-\gamma}\right) \times \exp\left(-\tau_{\text{EBL}}\right).
\]  
Throughout the analysis, only the normalization was allowed to vary during optimization since internal absorption primarily affects energies above about 5–6 GeV, at which point photon statistics become limited.","The analysis yielded significant results for one of the nine high-redshift blazars, specifically 4FGL J0733.8+0455 (also referred to as Source 3, with \(z=3.01\)). The inclusion of internal \(\gamma-\gamma\) absorption in the spectral model resulted in an improved Test Statistic (TS) compared to the baseline model assuming zero internal opacity. Optimization of the distance \(d\) from the SMBH demonstrated that the TS curve exhibited a notable drop at \(d \approx 0.93\, R_{\mathrm{BLR}}\) with a significance of approximately \(4\sigma\), thereby suggesting a constraint of \(d \geq 0.93\, R_{\mathrm{BLR}}\) or \(d \geq 0.186\, \mathrm{pc}\). The best-fit value was determined to be \(d = 0.19^{+0.018}_{-0.004}\, \mathrm{pc}\), or equivalently \(d / R_{\mathrm{BLR}} = 0.95^{+0.09}_{-0.02}\). For the other sources in the sample, variations in TS were not statistically significant (\(\Delta \mathrm{TS} < 4\)), largely due to insufficient high-energy photon statistics, which prevented the extraction of meaningful constraints regarding internal opacity effects.","The results suggest that for 4FGL J0733.8+0455, there is a mild internal \(\gamma-\gamma\) absorption effect, consistent with the \(\gamma\)-ray emission region being located near the inner boundary or within the central portion of the BLR. The observed drop in the TS curve at \(d \approx 0.93\, R_{\mathrm{BLR}}\) indicates that emitting regions located significantly closer to the SMBH, where the density of BLR photons would induce stronger absorption, are disfavored. This interpretation remains largely independent of the precise \(\gamma\)-ray production mechanism, as it fundamentally relies on the assumption that the GeV \(\gamma\)-rays are produced in proximity to the BLR. Consequently, if the \(\gamma\)-rays were instead generated much further out (for example, near the dusty torus), the internal absorption features would be negligible and would not manifest as observed.","The constraints derived from this study provide valuable insights into the structure and location of the \(\gamma\)-ray emitting region in high-redshift blazars, highlighting the potential of internal \(\gamma-\gamma\) absorption as a diagnostic tool. Although the analysis was limited by photon statistics for most high-redshift sources, the results for 4FGL J0733.8+0455 suggest that future studies should focus on intermediate-redshift blazars (\(z \sim 1-3\)) with harder spectra, where absorption features might emerge at higher energies with improved signal-to-noise. The advent of the next generation instruments, such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), with its lower energy threshold (around \(10\, \mathrm{GeV}\)) and complementary coverage alongside Fermi-LAT, promises to enhance energy coverage and sensitivity. This will ultimately allow for deeper exploration of internal \(\gamma-\gamma\) opacity and more precise constraints on the location of the \(\gamma\)-ray emission regions as well as the physical conditions within blazar environments."
2502.03913,ALMA observations of massive clouds in the central molecular zone: slim filaments tracing parsec-scale shocks,Kai Yang et al.,"The central molecular zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy, representing the inner 500 pc, is a remarkably massive and dense gas reservoir with a total mass \(>10^{7}\, M_{\odot}\) and number densities \(>10^{4}\, \mathrm{cm}^{-3}\). This region exhibits widespread emissions of silicon monoxide (SiO) and complex organic molecules (COMs), phenomena typically associated with shocked gas. Previous studies have revealed parsec-scale shocks through broad molecular line widths (approximately \(5-10\, \mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}\)) and unusual chemical characteristics, yet the origin of these emissions remains unclear. Observations in nearby clouds show equilibrium filaments with widths around 0.1 pc, while the CMZ environment may present fundamentally different structural and dynamical conditions.","The motivation behind the study is to elucidate the origin of the unexpected SiO and COM emissions in the CMZ. Despite evidence of shock activity and dynamic interactions, the precise nature and formation mechanism of filamentary structures and their role in the observed chemistry have not been conclusively determined. Understanding these shock-driven processes is crucial, as they may decouple gas and dust temperatures, trigger “hot-core like” chemistry, and potentially influence the overall star formation efficiency within this extreme environment.","High-resolution observations were conducted using ALMA’s C40-3 and C40-5 configurations, targeting four clouds in the CMZ (the \(20\, \mathrm{km/s}\) cloud, the \(50\, \mathrm{km/s}\) cloud, cloud e, and Sgr C) at frequencies spread over \(217-221\, \mathrm{GHz}\) and \(231-235\, \mathrm{GHz}\). The data reduction employed CASA’s tclean task, achieving a synthesized beam of approximately \(0.28^{\prime\prime} \times 0.19^{\prime\prime}\) (\(2200\, \mathrm{AU} \times 1500\, \mathrm{AU}\)) and a spectral rms noise level of \(1.6-2.0\, \mathrm{mJy/beam}\) (equivalent to \(0.8-1.0\, \mathrm{K}\)) per 0.976 MHz channel. In addition to SiO 5-4, eight other molecular lines—including transitions of \(c\textrm{-}C_{3}H_{2}\), \(H_{2}CO\), and \(CH_{3}OH\)—were detected. Tools such as FilFinder were used to extract the structural skeletons of filaments, while Gaussian fitting of the SiO 5-4 spectra provided insights into their velocity dispersions. The analysis further assumed local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and optically thin conditions to derive molecular column densities, guided by spectroscopic parameters obtained from databases like CDMS, JPL, and LAMDA.","The study led to the discovery of “slim filaments” in the CMZ that are long (extending over \(>0.5\, \mathrm{pc}\)) and extremely narrow (with deconvolved widths averaging around \(0.024\, \mathrm{pc}\) and never exceeding \(0.03\, \mathrm{pc}\)). These structures, clearly detected in SiO 5-4 emission but absent from continuum maps, exhibit coherent velocities that are inconsistent with those expected from protostellar outflows. Velocity dispersions, estimated from the SiO spectra, ranged between \(3.7\) and \(5.6\, \mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}\), implying full width at half-maximum (FWHM) line widths of approximately \(8.9-13.2\, \mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}\). Additionally, the filaments show high aspect ratios (\(>10\)) and column densities and relative molecular abundances that mirror those found in protostellar outflows rather than in dense cores. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests comparing relative abundances normalized to \(CH_{3}OH\) indicated no significant difference when compared with outflows (with \(p\) values of 0.68 and 0.14 for comparison with IRAS 20126+4104), but a significant deviation from the chemical signatures of dense cores (\(p=0.02\)).","The coherent velocity structures and shock-like chemical abundances point towards a shock-driven origin for these slim filaments. The dominance of turbulent pressure, estimated to be of the order \(P_{\text{turb}} \approx 1.7 \times 10^{10}\, \mathrm{K\,cm}^{-3}\), far exceeds the contributions from thermal, gravitational, magnetic, and external pressures. This pressure imbalance suggests that the filaments are not in hydrostatic equilibrium, indicating that they are transient features with an approximate dissipation timescale of \(\sim 5.2 \times 10^{3}\) years—a timescale comparable to SiO freeze-out. The presence of Class I \(CH_{3}OH\) masers and the absence of detectable dust in these regions further support a scenario in which shocks, possibly arising from the dynamic interaction between external shock waves and magnetized molecular clouds, produce and sustain these filaments.","The discovery of slim filaments as a distinct population within the CMZ has important implications for our understanding of the region’s chemical and dynamical evolution. With an estimated SiO mass of about \(1.3\, M_{\odot}\) and a required replenishment rate of \(\sim 1.3 \times 10^{-4}\, M_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\), it is estimated that around 8000 such filaments would be necessary to balance depletion processes. Their surface density of approximately \(0.7\, \mathrm{pc}^{-2}\) reinforces the notion that these shock-induced structures play a significant role in enriching the CMZ with SiO and COMs. Ultimately, the findings suggest that the interplay between parsec-scale shocks and molecular cloud dynamics is key to sustaining the unusual chemical composition of the CMZ, potentially influencing star formation and the energy balance in the central regions of the Galaxy."
2502.04198,The Merging Galaxy Cluster Environment Affects the Morphology of Radio-AGN,Mary Rickel et al.,"Galaxy clusters play a crucial role in shaping the properties and evolution of their constituent galaxies. The dense environments of clusters influence star formation rates, overall morphology, and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. In these environments, mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping and galaxy–galaxy harassment actively alter galaxy properties. In particular, radio-AGN, powered by supermassive black holes, are sensitive to environmental effects, and their morphologies can be significantly distorted when subjected to the complex physical processes present in clusters.","Although the impact of cluster mergers on the intra-cluster medium (ICM) has been extensively documented, less is known about how these dynamic environments affect the galaxies themselves, especially the morphology of radio-AGN. This study is motivated by the need to understand whether the merging of galaxy clusters, which disturbs the ICM and potentially triggers AGN activity, can also alter the observed appearance and detection characteristics of radio-AGN across radio and optical wavelengths. The investigation seeks to clarify the influence of merging environments on radio-AGN morphology and to determine if such conditions preferentially foster characteristics such as disturbed or bent radio jets.","The study builds on a galaxy cluster sample originally derived by Bilton et al. (2020) from SDSS DR8, selecting clusters with X-ray luminosities in the range \(1 < L_X \leq 20 \times 10^{44} \, \mathrm{erg} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\) to ensure that only the most massive, well-assembled clusters were included. Cluster memberships were determined through surface caustics, and the dynamical state of each cluster was classified using the Dressler \& Shectman \(\Delta\)-test. AGN candidates were identified with WHAN diagrams, utilizing \(\mathrm{H}\alpha\) and [NII] \(\lambda 6584\) emission lines with thresholds set at \(\log_{10}([\mathrm{NII}]/\mathrm{H}\alpha) \geq -0.32\) and \(\mathrm{EW}_{\mathrm{H}\alpha} \geq 6 \AA\). Duplicate sources were removed, leading to a final pool of 2,298 objects. The study employed radio continuum data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) at 144 MHz with a resolution of \(6^{\prime\prime}\). Out of 33 clusters, 12 (comprising 9 non-merging and 3 merging clusters) were fully covered by both LoTSS and SDSS. Completeness analysis confirmed that merging clusters have approximately \(75\%\) of the members and \(80\%\) of the mass of non-mergers, and redshift distributions were well-matched with a mean \(z\) of 0.06 in both cases. Radio-AGN morphology was classified using cutouts of LoTSS images (with sizes scaled to \(2r_{200} \times 2r_{200}\) and ranging from \(12^{\prime\prime} \times 12^{\prime\prime}\) for compact sources to \(60^{\prime\prime} \times 60^{\prime\prime}\) for extended emission) with contours starting at \(4\sigma\) and displayed on logarithmic scales. A visual classification scheme was then implemented via Zooniverse, where five team members classified 191 radio-detected sources into categories such as Weak Compact (WC), Strong Compact (SC), Compact Extended (CE), FRI, FRII, FRM, Extended (E), Bent Tail (BT), Head Tail (HT), among others. Consensus levels were established based on the level of agreement among classifiers (with level 4 requiring 4–5 of 5 classifiers, level 3 requiring 3/5 including level 4, and non-consensus being 2/5 or less). After quality filtering and the removal of duplicates or ambiguous cases, 157 sources remained. Further filtering of compact radio sources was achieved by comparing the measured \(L_{150 \, \mathrm{MHz}}\) against star-formation-derived \(L_{150 \, \mathrm{MHz}, \mathrm{SF}}\) using a factor of 3 threshold to distinguish AGN from star-forming galaxies, ultimately yielding 54 confirmed radio-AGN. Bayesian statistical methods, particularly through posterior distributions modeled as Beta distributions and using Jeffreys intervals, were employed to compare proportions of radio morphologies between merging and non-merging clusters. A one-tailed test was utilized to interpret probability comparisons in terms of Gaussian significance levels.","The radio-AGN morphologies were consolidated into several groups: Compact (C), Compact Extended (CE), Extended (E), Jetted, and Disturbed. In non-merging clusters, the proportions for Compact and Compact Extended sources were approximately \(0.59_{-0.08}^{+0.08}\) and \(0.16_{-0.05}^{+0.07}\), respectively, while merging clusters exhibited proportions of \(0.53_{-0.12}^{+0.12}\) (C) and \(0.06_{-0.04}^{+0.07}\) (CE), with the differences being statistically insignificant (\(\sigma < 1\)). Notably, Extended sources were found exclusively in non-mergers at a proportion of \(0.14_{-0.06}^{+0.06}\), and Jetted sources demonstrated similar fractions in both environments (\(0.12_{-0.06}^{+0.09}\) in mergers compared to \(0.08_{-0.04}^{+0.05}\) in non-mergers). A marked finding was the significantly higher fraction of Disturbed sources in merging clusters—\(0.29_{-0.10}^{+0.11}\) compared to \(0.03_{-0.02}^{+0.04}\) in non-merging clusters at a confidence level of \(3\sigma\), which is likely attributable to the effects of ICM bulk motion and ram pressure. Additionally, mergers displayed a marginally higher occurrence of radio-only AGN (with a \(2\sigma\) significance and a probability of \(\operatorname{Pr}(\mathrm{AGN}_{\text{Rad}} > \mathrm{AGN}_{\text{Rad-Opt}}) = 0.96\)) compared to radio+optical AGN, while non-mergers did not show a significant difference (\(\operatorname{Pr} = 0.59\)). However, when directly comparing the probability of radio-only AGN in merging versus non-merging clusters, the value of \(\operatorname{Pr}(\mathrm{M}>\mathrm{NM})\) was only 0.14, indicating no strong overall trend.","The results suggest that merging cluster environments notably influence radio-AGN morphology by increasing the fraction of disturbed radio sources. This disturbance is likely caused by enhanced ICM interactions, including bulk motion and ram pressure, that can bend or distort radio jets. The exclusive presence of head-tail systems in merging clusters provides further evidence of extreme ram pressure effects in these dynamic environments. The observation of a higher fraction of radio-only AGN in mergers may be indicative of a relationship with low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs). While non-merging clusters showed a broader range of radio morphology, including extended sources that may be related to starburst activity or galaxy mergers, merging clusters appear to preferentially host radio-AGN that exhibit signatures of ICM-induced disturbance.","The findings of this study imply that cluster mergers have a substantial effect on the radio morphology of AGN, highlighting the importance of environmental factors in shaping AGN characteristics. The clear association between merging environments and an increased proportion of disturbed and bent radio sources reinforces the need for a multiwavelength approach in accurately determining cluster dynamics. These insights suggest that environmental processes such as ram pressure stripping and ICM bulk motion are crucial in modifying the appearance of radio jets and may help distinguish between different AGN excitation classes. Future investigations with larger cluster samples, improved classification techniques, and more uniform multiwavelength data are essential to further disentangle the roles of HERGs and LERGs and to refine our understanding of the interplay between cluster dynamics and AGN activity."
2502.04278,Probing Spin-Orbit Resonances with the Binary Black Hole Population,Sylvia Biscoveanu,"Recent observations by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration have revealed nearly 300 gravitational-wave detections from binary black hole (BBH) mergers. These observations have unveiled intricate substructures in the mass distributions, indicate generally small spin magnitudes, and show merger rates that evolve with redshift. Moreover, the orientations of the black hole spins, including spin tilts and azimuthal angles, have emerged as key discriminators between different formation channels. While field binaries are expected to have spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum, dynamically formed systems exhibit largely random orientations. Prior population studies have ruled out anti-aligned spins and even hinted at excesses around \(\cos \theta \sim 0.3\). In addition, the effective aligned spin parameter \( \chi_{\text{eff}} \) favors positive values, supporting the field binary formation channel, and the possibility of spin-axis alterations during black hole birth has further complicated the classical picture. Within this context, spin-orbit resonances (SORs) – particularly the tendency for the spin azimuthal angle \(\phi_{12}\) to cluster near \(0\) or \(\pm \pi\) due to post-Newtonian dynamics and mass transfer effects – have garnered increasing attention as a promising avenue to probe the astrophysical origins and evolution of BBH systems.","The primary motivation of this study is to use a hierarchical analysis of binary black hole spin distributions via gravitational waves to probe spin-orbit resonances. By constraining the distribution of \(\phi_{12}\) and uncovering excesses near \(0\) and \(\pm \pi\), the work aims to distinguish isotropic spin configurations from those that reflect structured azimuthal and tilt distributions emerging from evolutionary scenarios. An astrophysically informed model is developed with the goal of constraining mass ratio reversal (RMR) fractions alongside the alignment properties inherent to field binaries. This model directly addresses the challenges posed by the complexity of spin dynamics, including the competing influences of large spins, small tilt angles, comparable mass ratios, and small separations, and leverages full parameter estimation methods to assess the detectability of SORs in both simulated populations and real data (e.g. GWTC-3).","The study employs a comprehensive simulation campaign that includes four distinct BBH populations—strong resonances, mixed isotropic-resonant, fully isotropic, and weak resonances—with 200 events each. The simulated mass distributions follow a Power-Law + Peak formulation, while the spins are drawn from a Beta distribution and redshifts adhere to a power-law up to \(z=1.9\). Spin tilts (\(\theta_{1,2}\)) and azimuthal angles (\(\phi_{12}\)) are modeled using a mixture of isotropic and aligned components, with roughly 30% of the simulated systems undergoing mass ratio reversal. Bayesian parameter estimation is performed with BiLBY and the Dynesty nested sampler; this process employs uniform priors on redshifted component masses, spin magnitudes, azimuthal angles, and \(\cos \theta\) values as well as a comoving volume prior on luminosity distance. Depending on the masses, either the NRSur7dq4 surrogate model or IMRPhenomXPHM is used, with spin parameters specified at a reference frequency \(M f_{\text{ISCO}} = 6^{-3/2}/\pi\) and evolved to ISCO frequency via GWSurrogate or SpinTaylorT5. In addition, hierarchical Bayesian inference via GWPopulation is applied to extract posteriors on hyper-parameters governing the population distributions, with spin angle models such as the FuLL and Simple tilt models employed to probe correlations in \(\phi_{12}\) and tilt distributions. The methodology carefully accounts for selection biases using Monte Carlo integrals over sensitivity injections (over ten million injections in total) and further explores the role of surrogate dynamics versus post-Newtonian evolution for reliable spin measurements. Details from sensitivity injection campaigns, variance minimization in Monte Carlo integrals (with \(\sigma_{\text{tot}}^2 \leq 5\) for robustness), and systematic effects introduced by waveform inconsistencies are also incorporated to ensure that both spin angle and mass distribution recoveries are reliably assessed.","For the strong resonances population, hyper-parameters related to spin angles \(\cos \theta_{1}\), \(\cos \theta_{2}\), and \(\phi_{12}\) are recovered within \(3\sigma\) credible intervals. In this case, the Full tilt model accurately captures the underlying distributions, with the mixture fraction \(\xi\) constrained to \(\xi > 0.9\) at over \(95\%\) credibility and with narrow posterior constraints on the mass ratio reversal fraction \(f_{\text{RMR}} \lesssim 0.7\). For mixed populations (strong resonances combined with an isotropic component), both the true hyper-parameters and the \(\phi_{12}\) distribution are recovered within acceptable credible intervals, with the Simple + separate \(\xi_{\text{VM}}\) model highlighting the decoupling between tilt and azimuth information. Analyses of fully isotropic populations confirm no spurious evidence for SORs, as the recovered \(\phi_{12}\) distributions strongly favor isotropy regardless of whether \(\mu_{\text{RMR}}, \mu_{\text{SMR}}\) are left free or fixed. The spin tilt distributions, which remain roughly flat, show \(\xi\) constrained to \(\lesssim 0.3\) at \(95\%\) credibility under both Simple and Full tilt models—a notable contrast to the Default LVK model. In the case of a weak resonances population, which features broader tilt distributions similar to those observed in GWTC-3, the analysis successfully recovers the underlying \(\phi_{12}\) distribution at high credibility, although constraints on \(f_{\text{RMR}}\) and the concentration parameter \(\kappa\) are less robust and subject to biases in \(\xi\) arising from neglected correlations between \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\). Analysis of GWTC-3 data with both the Simple and Full tilt frameworks shows no significant evidence for SORs, although a weak preference for \(\phi_{12} = \pm \pi\) is observed, aligning with expectations for standard mass ratio (SMR) scenarios. Auxiliary investigations, including comparisons of independent strong resonance populations and extensive sensitivity injection campaigns (as detailed in Appendices A and B), further underscore the impact of sample size, the potential for hyper-parameter biases, and the importance of employing flexible models. Finally, a results summary provided in Appendix D presents maximum-posterior values and \(95\%\) credible intervals for \(f_{\text{RMR}}, \kappa,\) and \(\xi\) across various analyses, while also highlighting systematic challenges such as the persistent bias in spin magnitude recovery due to limited exploration of small-spin regions and selection effects.","The results suggest that the \(\phi_{12}\) distribution is a powerful probe for distinguishing between resonant and isotropic spin configurations in BBH populations. When the spin tilt information is coupled with the azimuthal angle data, the analysis is able to constrain crucial aspects of the binary evolution, such as the mass ratio reversal fraction \(f_{\text{RMR}}\) and the mixture fraction \(\xi\). However, the interpretation of these phenomenological hyper-parameters is highly model-dependent, as seen from the variations between the Simple, Full, and Default LVK tilt models. Although the Full tilt model more accurately recovers the true distributions in some cases, biases—particularly in the inferred values of \(\xi\) and in the demarcation between RMR and SMR scenarios—remain due to overlapping priors and neglected correlations. The study’s findings emphasize caution when extrapolating astrophysical implications from phenomenological models, as systematic uncertainties, sample size effects, and selection biases can significantly influence the recovered distributions and inferred astrophysical fractions.","This work has important implications for the future study of BBH populations and the associated astrophysical inferences drawn from gravitational-wave data. While current O4 data may not yield definitive evidence for spin-orbit resonances, the refined analysis methods presented here, especially those leveraging \(\phi_{12}\) inferrence and comprehensive hierarchical Bayesian frameworks, offer a promising route to constrain the spin dynamics and formation channels of BBHs. The successful recovery of simulated populations, despite challenges related to model dependence and sample size, paves the way for more robust investigations in future observing runs. Moreover, the demonstration that even subtle excesses around \(\phi_{12} = \pm \pi\) can hint at underlying mass transfer and binary evolutionary processes suggests that continued methodological improvements—potentially via density estimators or emulators—will enhance our ability to disentangle complex astrophysical signals. Ultimately, these findings will inform refinements in population synthesis models and improve our understanding of the origin, evolution, and astrophysical environments of compact binary systems."
2502.03995,Modeling fast X-ray variability around an accreting black hole,Yejing Zhan et al.,"Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) are systems in which a stellar-mass black hole accretes matter from a companion star, forming an accretion disc where viscous processes facilitate angular momentum transfer. These systems exhibit outbursts driven by disc instabilities that produce multi-wavelength radiation—predominantly in X-rays—with variability observed on timescales from milliseconds to days or years. The observed X-ray variability often reveals broad-band noise and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) that have been linked to relativistic precession and other disc phenomena. Notably, X-ray inter-band time lags manifest as hard lags (high-energy photons lagging low-energy ones) at low Fourier frequencies and soft lags (the reverse) at high frequencies, indicating that different physical processes are at play. Various observational studies, such as those examining MAXI J1820+070, have shown that these lags evolve during outbursts, with soft lag timescales shortening as the system evolves.","The primary impetus behind this study is to explore the mechanisms behind the evolution of fast X-ray variability in BHXRBs by reproducing and examining the observed behaviors of hard and soft lags. There is a need to ascertain how variations in corona geometry and disc viscous frequency contribute to these lags. While previous models like Reltrans and those proposed by Wilkins et al. (2016) have attempted to capture these phenomena, the emerging observational evidence suggests an extended corona with multiple emission components that cannot be fully explained by existing frameworks. Therefore, the study aims to improve upon previous simulations using a Monte Carlo framework to link the interplay of propagating accretion rate fluctuations and reverberation delays directly to the observed X-ray lag spectra.","The study employs Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations to model the complex interplay between the accretion disc and an extended corona. In the framework of the simulation, three primary radiative processes are considered: disc thermal emission, Comptonization in the corona, and disc reflection. Photons are generated on the disc and follow a blackbody spectrum according to the Novikov–Thorne model. When these photons interact with the corona—a region modeled as a hyperbolic surface with a semi-major axis \(a=10\,R_g\), a semi-minor axis \(b=2\,R_g\), and height boundaries \(h_b\) and \(h_t\)—a fraction undergoes Comptonization, producing a spectrum that follows a cutoff power-law form. Reflection is treated using the Xillver model with parameters including the photon index \(\Gamma\), ionization parameter \(\xi\), iron abundance \(A_{\mathrm{Fe}}\), and inclination angle \(i\). The simulation further incorporates accretion rate fluctuations based on the Ingram & Done framework, which propagate inward affecting the disc temperature and the resultant photon emission rate. By calculating photon weights, which encapsulate the combined effects of spatial delays and viscous timescales, the simulation reproduces both reverberation and propagation effects, thereby enabling the construction of lag spectra as a function of Fourier frequency.","The Monte Carlo simulations successfully reproduce the key observed phenomena in BHXRBs. Specifically, the simulations yield inter-band lag spectra that exhibit low-frequency hard lags and high-frequency soft lags. For a representative system with a black hole mass \(M=7\,M_{\odot}\), accretion rate \(\dot{m}=0.01\), disc temperature \(T_i=0.15\,\mathrm{keV}\), and a disc extending from an inner radius \(r_{\mathrm{in}}=10\,R_g\) to an outer radius \(r_{\mathrm{out}}=500\,R_g\), the light curves are generated with a temporal resolution of 1/1000 second over a 200-second interval. The time-averaged energy spectrum exhibits a cutoff power-law with \(\Gamma \sim 2\), a thermal peak near \(0.1\,\mathrm{keV}\), and a highly ionized reflection component. Focusing on the \(0.1\!\!-\!\!0.3\,\mathrm{keV}\) and \(2\!\!-\!\!5\,\mathrm{keV}\) energy bands, the lag spectra reveal that as the corona height decreases from \(35\,R_g\) to \(16\,R_g\) and the maximum viscous frequency increases from 2\,Hz to 30\,Hz, the amplitude of the soft lag diminishes and the zero-crossing point shifts to higher frequencies. These trends are in good agreement with the observed lag evolution in sources like MAXI J1820+070, and further simulations indicate that independent variations in coronal geometry and viscosity each imprint distinct lag patterns.","The reproduced lag spectra suggest that the physical origins of the observed lags in BHXRBs stem from the interplay between propagation delays and spatial (light travel time) delays in the disc-corona system. At low frequencies, the hard lags are predominantly influenced by slower propagation of accretion-rate fluctuations from the outer to inner disc regions. In contrast, the high-frequency soft lags arise because soft, thermal photons from the disc reach the corona more promptly than the hard, Comptonized photons are reprocessed and reflected by the disc. This dual behavior underscores the independent roles played by coronal geometry and disc viscosity. The simulation results, including those for a spherical corona model, support the notion that an extended, possibly vertically elongated corona is more consistent with polarization observations, particularly those expected from missions like IXPE. Discrepancies in the lag spectra above 1\,keV further highlight the need to incorporate detailed models of coronal fluctuation propagation in future studies.","The study’s findings have significant implications for advancing our understanding of the inner accretion flow geometry in BHXRBs. By correlating changes in corona height and disc viscous frequency with the evolution of time lags, the research lays the groundwork for interpreting X-ray variability in terms of physical changes in the accretion environment. Future polarization observations from missions such as IXPE and eXTP are anticipated to provide crucial constraints on the geometry of the corona, potentially ruling out simplified models such as the spherical corona in favor of more complex, vertically extended structures. These insights not only enrich our theoretical comprehension of accretion processes but also offer practical guidelines for interpreting X-ray timing and spectral observations during different states of BHXRB outbursts."
2502.03730,On the relationship between the cosmic web and the alignment of galaxies and AGN jets,S. Lyla Jung et al.,"The evolution of galaxies is intricately linked with the activity of their central supermassive black holes and the large-scale cosmic web in which they reside. Observations have long indicated that active galactic nuclei (AGN) can impact star formation through feedback mechanisms—both radiative, which heats the surrounding gas, and mechanical, driven by jet outflows. Additionally, the spatial orientation of radio jets relative to host galaxies and the underlying cosmic structure has emerged as a critical aspect of understanding galaxy evolution. The study builds on previous investigations that have utilized extensive data from surveys such as LOFAR, DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to explore the interplay between galactic properties and their cosmic milieu.","Motivated by the need to unravel how large-scale cosmic filaments influence both the morphological evolution of galaxies and the orientation of AGN jets, this study seeks to understand the relationships between galaxy alignments, radio jet directions, and the cosmic web. Observational evidence suggests that, at certain distances, the optical major axes of galaxies tend to align with the nearby filaments, while radio jets display different, sometimes perpendicular, alignment trends. By investigating these interactions in detail, the study aims to shed light on the dual impact of merger-driven growth and chaotic gas accretion on galaxy structure and AGN feedback mechanisms.","The investigation employs a multiwavelength observational approach by combining data from LoTSS DR2, the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, and cosmic filament catalogues derived from SDSS using the DisPerSE algorithm. LoTSS DR2, which covers 27% of the northern sky and identifies approximately 4 million radio sources, provides detailed radio imaging along with cross-matched optical and infrared data using likelihood-ratio techniques and visual inspection via the Radio Galaxy Zoo project. Optical properties such as ellipticities are extracted from the DESI Legacy Surveys, allowing for the determination of galaxy position angles, while cosmic filaments are characterized from SDSS data (spanning \(z \approx 0-0.8\)) through careful 3D analysis that uses parameters like density field smoothing and persistence thresholds. Two distinct samples are analyzed: the General Massive Radio Galaxy (GMRG) sample, consisting of 84,409 sources with stellar masses \(M_* > 10^{11} M_\odot\), and the Extended Jet (EJ) sample, comprising 7,297 sources selected for high signal-to-noise, luminosity criteria (\(L_{144} > 10^{24} \, \mathrm{W \, Hz^{-1}}\)), size limits (LAS \(> 20\) arcsec), and accurate radio position angle measurements. Angle comparisons, including the use of a parallel transport method to account for spherical geometry and proper adjustments (\(\lesssim 3^\circ\)), are employed to quantify the alignments between galaxy optical axes, radio jets, and filament orientations.","Analysis of the GMRG sample reveals that galaxies located within \(\lesssim 11 \, \mathrm{Mpc}\) of cosmic filaments exhibit a tendency for their optical major axes to align with the orientation of those filaments, especially near the filament spines. In contrast, results from the EJ sample indicate that radio jets are generally aligned perpendicularly to their host galaxies' major axes, with a clear peak at \(90^\circ\). However, this perpendicular alignment weakens near cosmic filaments (\(D_{\text{fil}} \lesssim 8\, \mathrm{Mpc}\)), where the orientation of jets becomes increasingly randomized. These trends are substantiated by statistical tests, including KS tests, which reject a uniform distribution of jet orientations at the \(95\%\) confidence level and confirm distinct differences in alignment distributions when comparing environments close to and far from filaments.","The contrasting alignment behaviors underscore the complex interplay between galactic structure and the large-scale cosmic environment. The alignment of optical galaxy major axes with nearby filaments supports a scenario in which massive galaxies primarily grow via directional mergers that occur along the filamentary structure, thereby imprinting the cosmic web’s orientation onto their underlying stellar distributions. Conversely, the tendency for radio jets to be perpendicular to the galaxy major axis in isolation, and the observed degradation of this alignment near filaments, suggest that chaotic gas accretion and galaxy interactions in these environments can disrupt otherwise orderly accretion flows. These observations are in agreement with numerical simulations where massive halos align with filaments due to directional infall, while accretion processes affecting the central black holes become more isotropic in regions of strong filamentary influence.","The study’s findings have broad implications for our understanding of galaxy evolution and AGN feedback in the context of the cosmic web. The intrinsic galaxy alignments with filaments, particularly for massive systems, have potential consequences for weak lensing measurements in cosmological surveys, as well as for the interpretation of large-scale jet alignments observed in radio wavelengths. Moreover, the environmental modulation of the AGN jet orientation—transitioning from a clear perpendicular trend to a more randomized distribution near filaments—highlights how the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is likely affected by anisotropic outflows and jets. These results emphasize the need to account for cosmic environment effects when modeling AGN feedback and the evolution of galaxies across cosmic time."
2502.04114,"SIMULTANEOUS EXISTENCE OF THE OCSILLATIONS, COUNTERSTREAMING FLOWS AND MASS INJECTIONS IN SOLAR QUIESCENT PROMINENCES",Xiaoli Yan et al.,"Solar quiescent prominences are long-lived, cool, and dense structures suspended within the hot solar corona. They are characterized by complex structures including a spine, bubbles, and legs (barbs) and exhibit a variety of dynamic behaviors such as counterstreaming flows, periodic mass movements, and oscillations. These prominences typically maintain temperatures below \(2 \times 10^{4} \, \mathrm{K}\) and electron densities between \(10^9\) and \(10^{11} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-3}\). Despite decades of observations, many of the driving mechanisms—such as the origins of counterstreaming flows and the interactions that trigger oscillatory motions—remain poorly understood, with some simulations suggesting that turbulent heating at the solar surface might play a role in these processes.","The primary motivation of this study is to elucidate the physical mechanisms underlying the simultaneous occurrence of oscillations, counterstreaming flows, and mass injections within solar quiescent prominences. By addressing the unresolved questions about how these processes interact—specifically, how periodic oscillatory motions and localized mass injections contribute to the observed Doppler signals and overall dynamics—the investigation seeks to reconcile observational evidence with theoretical models such as chromospheric evaporation–coronal condensation and direct mass injection scenarios. The integration of high-resolution, multiwavelength observations offers a promising approach to better understand the formation and maintenance of these complex solar structures.","To probe these dynamics, high-resolution observational data were acquired using multiple instruments. The New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) provided detailed \(\mathrm{H} \alpha\) line-center images as well as off-band images at \(6562.8 \, \AA, \ 6562.8 \pm 0.4 \, \AA,\) and \(6562.8 \pm 0.7 \, \AA\) with a spatial resolution of \(0.3''\) and a cadence of approximately 76 seconds; the data were carefully calibrated and coaligned with an accuracy of \(0.1''\). Complementary observations were obtained from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/AIA, offering EUV images at \(304 \, \AA,\, 171 \, \AA,\) and \(211 \, \AA\) with a cadence of 12 seconds, while the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) captured Mg II h \(2803.5 \, \AA\) spectra through five large coarse raster scans. Dopplergrams were constructed from the spectral data to analyze Doppler shifts, and velocities were derived using time–distance diagrams and linear fits, as well as Gauss fitting profiles that measured peak intensity, Doppler velocity, and line width.","The observations of the prominence on 2016 August 17 reveal a multifaceted dynamic behavior across different regions of the structure. In emissive \(304 \, \AA\) and \(\mathrm{H} \alpha\) images, alongside absorptive signatures in \(211 \, \AA\) and mixed features in \(171 \, \AA\), the prominence exhibits a spine nearly parallel to the solar limb that is interspersed with bubbles and barbs. A pronounced longitudinal oscillation was detected in the upper spine, characterized by an 83-minute period and an amplitude of 32 Mm as seen in \(\mathrm{H} \alpha\). The oscillation velocities ranged from 11 to 17 \(\mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\), while transverse oscillations of threads perpendicular to the spine exhibited periods of 12 to 17 minutes and amplitudes of approximately 3 Mm. In the central spine, counterstreaming flows with speeds between 4 and 11 \(\mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\) were clearly observed using both \(\mathrm{H} \alpha\) center and off-band images and confirmed via Dopplergrams. Additionally, IRIS Mg II h data revealed alternating blueshifts and redshifts—with measured Doppler velocities of \(-8.26 \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\) and \(5.02 \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\)—which further support the periodic oscillation signatures. Two distinct types of mass injection were identified: upward plumes emerging from bubble boundaries injected mass into the spine at velocities of 22 to 30 \(\mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\) (with redshifted signals in one instance and blueshifted signals at 5 to 11 \(\mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\) in another), while tornado-like barbs contributed mass injections from their footpoints at velocities ranging from 6 to 15 \(\mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\). The interplay of these processes results in complex Doppler imagery, with alternating redshifted and blueshifted signatures reflecting localized injection events and oscillatory motions.","The complex dynamics observed within the prominence suggest that the longitudinal oscillations, counterstreaming flows, and mass injections are intricately linked. The well-defined oscillations in the upper spine align closely with simulation predictions, indicating that these behaviors may be driven by intrinsic properties of the prominence’s magnetic structure. Meanwhile, the irregular Doppler signatures in the lower spine are interpreted as a consequence of intermittent mass injections—both from upward plumes and tornado-like barbs—which disturb the local flow patterns and superpose additional dynamic signals onto the underlying oscillatory motions. Gauss fitting of spectral profiles and time–distance analyses further corroborate that these processes coexist and mutually influence one another, supporting models that incorporate both chromospheric evaporation–coronal condensation and direct injection mechanisms.","These findings advance our understanding of solar prominence dynamics by demonstrating the simultaneous coexistence and interplay of oscillations, counterstreaming flows, and mass injections. The validation of both the chromospheric evaporation–coronal condensation and direct injection models highlights the complex coupling between solar surface phenomena and coronal structure evolution. Such insights are critical for improving predictive models of solar atmospheric dynamics and for assessing the stability of prominences under varying solar conditions. By integrating data from NVST, IRIS, and SDO, this study provides a comprehensive observational framework that can be applied to future investigations of coronal heating, mass transport processes, and the broader energetics of the solar atmosphere."
2502.03745,Identifying Compton－thick AGNs in the COSMOS,Xiaotong Guo et al.,"Compton-thick active galactic nuclei (CT-AGNs) are a class of heavily obscured AGNs characterized by column densities \(N_{\mathrm{H}} \geqslant 1.5 \times 10^{24}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\) that render their X-ray emissions extremely weak. Despite this faintness, CT-AGNs are thought to contribute significantly to the cosmic X-ray background (CXB), with theoretical models suggesting they comprise 30% or more of the total AGN population. However, surveys such as COSMOS have reported much lower observed fractions, indicating that many CT-AGNs remain hidden, especially among AGNs that register low X-ray photon counts. The complexity of their X-ray spectra—which include components such as corona emission, disk reflection, soft excess, and polar scattering—further complicates their detection and analysis.","The primary motivation behind this work is to unearth the missing CT-AGN population by employing a multiwavelength approach. Given that CT-AGNs are too obscured to be easily detected by X-ray observations alone, the study aims to analyze multiwavelength data in order to identify these elusive objects. By addressing the discrepancy between the expected and observed CT-AGN fractions, the study seeks to reconcile CXB models with actual survey data and enhance our understanding of AGN demographics.","The study is based on a comprehensive sample of 440 AGNs selected from the COSMOS survey, which spans \(2\,\mathrm{deg}^2\) and provides extensive multiwavelength coverage from the ultraviolet to the far-infrared. X-ray data obtained from both XMM-Newton and Chandra—specifically the Chandra COSMOS Legacy Survey with a 4.6 Ms exposure—were employed to obtain counts in the \(0.5-7\,\mathrm{keV}\) band and corrected observed luminosities in the \(2-10\,\mathrm{keV}\) range. Rigorous sample selection criteria ensured extragalactic origin, reliable optical counterparts, low X-ray counts (fewer than 30 counts in the \(0.5-7\,\mathrm{keV}\) band), and availability of multiwavelength photometry (including Spitzer IRAC and MIPS \(24\,\mu\mathrm{m}\)). Accurate redshift determination was prioritized using spectral redshifts when possible and photometric redshifts otherwise, with corrections applied to X-ray luminosities following the relationship  
\[
\frac{L_{\text{new}}}{L_{\text{old}}}=\frac{R\left(z_{\text{new}}\right)^2\left(1+z_{\text{new}}\right)^{\Gamma-2}}{R\left(z_{\text{old}}\right)^2\left(1+z_{\text{old}}\right)^{\Gamma-2}},
\]  
where \(\Gamma = 1.4\). The study then leveraged spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using the Python-based CIGALE (V2022.1) code to estimate key galaxy and AGN parameters such as the rest-frame \(6\,\mu\mathrm{m}\) luminosity, stellar mass (\(M_{\star}\)), and star formation rate (SFR). SFRs were calculated from combined UV and infrared luminosities using the equation  
\[
\operatorname{SFR}\left(M_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\right)=1.09 \times 10^{-9}\left(3.3\,L_{\mathrm{UV}}+L_{\mathrm{IR}}\right).
\]  
Optical and near-infrared spectra were decomposed using PyQSOFit to extract high-ionization emission lines such as [O III] \(\lambda 5007\), [O II] \(\lambda 3727\), and [Ne V] \(\lambda 3426\). Multiwavelength diagnostic criteria were then applied: the correlation between X-ray and mid-infrared (MIR) emissions was analyzed in relation to established relations from prior studies, while optical emission line diagnostics—particularly using narrow-line region features—provided additional classification avenues. For sources at \(z > 1\), [O III] luminosities were estimated from [O II] luminosities assuming a [O II]/[O III] ratio between 0.1 and 0.6. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Schwarz weights played a role in assessing the reliability of including AGN components in the SED fits, with the AGN probability expressed as \(\alpha_{\text{AGN}} = \text{weight}\).","From the selected sample of 440 AGNs, a multiwavelength analysis yielded the identification of 18 CT-AGNs. Out of these, MIR diagnostics—comparing observed \(2-10\,\mathrm{keV}\) X-ray luminosities with rest-frame \(6\,\mu\mathrm{m}\) luminosities using relationships from Chen et al. (2017), Stern (2015), and Fiore et al. (2009)—flagged three high-confidence CT-AGNs, after excluding sources with low AGN confidence. In parallel, optical emission line diagnostics identified seven CT-AGNs based on significant detections of [O III] \(\lambda 5007\) (with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 3). For higher-redshift sources where direct [O III] measurements were not available, this line was estimated from [O II] \(\lambda 3727\), thereby diagnosing an additional ten CT-AGNs. One further candidate was flagged via the [Ne V] \(\lambda 3426\) line, and in total, 18 CT-AGNs were identified. Notably, only one source met the criteria across both MIR and optical diagnostics, while four AGNs (cid_2728, cid_3570, lid_3603, and lid_3901) displayed discrepancies between the methods. Additionally, the fraction of CT-AGNs in the sample was about 4.1%, remaining well below the theoretical expectations implied by CXB models.","The discrepancies between diagnostic methods suggest that variability in AGN emission, potential over- or underestimation of key emission line luminosities, and the inherent complexities in modeling obscured systems all contribute to challenges in CT-AGN identification. For instance, some AGNs displayed high-ionization emission consistent with CT-AGN status when assessed via optical lines, yet their MIR diagnostics indicated levels of absorption inconsistent with a Compton-thick classification. The methodology for estimating [O III] luminosities from [O II] measurements, while useful for high-redshift sources, also introduces risks of misclassification, although these appear to be minimized in this study. The analysis of host galaxy properties, including stellar masses and SFRs, through Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests revealed that there were no significant differences between CT-AGN hosts and those of non-CT-AGNs, suggesting a potential evolutionary distinction from local AGN environments.","The findings underscore the need to refine and integrate multiwavelength diagnostic techniques to reliably uncover the missing CT-AGN population. The lower than expected CT-AGN fraction implies that selection biases—stemming from reliance on SEDs, high-ionization emission lines, and current MIR diagnostic thresholds—may be limiting our understanding of AGN demographics. The observed discrepancies and potential misestimations in emission line luminosities call for further methodological improvements and more extensive future surveys. Enhanced detection strategies will not only reconcile observational data with theoretical CXB models but also shed light on the evolutionary pathways of AGNs and the dense, gas-rich environments in which early AGN growth occurs."
2502.03742,Radio emission from little red dots may reveal their true nature,Muhammad A. Latif et al.,"Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a population of compact, reddish objects at redshifts \(z=4-10\), known as little red dots (LRDs). These objects exhibit broad emission features and display spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that allow for two potential interpretations: they may be extremely starbursting galaxies or highly obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN). The detection of narrow, unresolved lines such as [O III] in their spectra, along with inferred bolometric luminosities of \(L_{\text{bol}}=10^{43-46} \, \mathrm{erg \, s}^{-1}\) and black hole (BH) masses of \(10^{6}-10^{8} \, M_{\odot}\), places them in an intriguing position for understanding early universe AGN activity and galaxy formation. Their cosmic abundance, approximately \(\sim 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-3} \, \mathrm{mag}^{-1}\), is significantly higher than that of quasars at comparable redshifts and offers valuable clues about AGN-galaxy coevolution, BH seeding, and cosmic reionization.","The primary motivation behind this work is to resolve the ambiguity surrounding the true nature of LRDs. Given that spectral energy distributions alone cannot decisively indicate whether these galaxies are powered predominantly by intense star formation or by accreting supermassive black holes, it becomes essential to investigate their radio emission properties. Disentangling the contributions from AGN and star formation will help clarify if these objects are dust-reddened AGN, in which case they would be largely radio-quiet, or if they are undergoing extreme starburst activity. This distinction is critical for understanding the role of these systems in early cosmic evolution and for guiding future surveys using next-generation radio facilities.","In order to estimate the radio emission from LRDs, the study employs a two-pronged numerical method that addresses radio contributions from both the central black hole and the host galaxy. For the AGN component, radio flux in the \(0.1-10 \, \mathrm{GHz}\) range is estimated using the fundamental plane (FP) of black hole accretion. This empirical relation connects the nuclear radio luminosity \(L_{\mathrm{R}}\) with the X-ray luminosity \(L_{\mathrm{X}}\) (in the 2–10 keV band) and the black hole mass \(M_{\mathrm{BH}}\) through the equation  
\[
\log L_{\mathrm{R}} = A \log L_{\mathrm{X}} + B \log M_{\mathrm{BH}} + C,
\]  
where the coefficients \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are adopted from the literature to account for both radio-loud and radio-quiet sources. With \(L_{\mathrm{X}}\) upper limits in the range of \(10^{43}-10^{44} \, \mathrm{erg \, s}^{-1}\) and \(M_{\mathrm{BH}}\) values of \(10^{6}-10^{7} \, M_{\odot}\), the radio luminosity is computed and then translated into observed flux using  
\[
F_{\nu} = \frac{L_{\nu'}(1+z)}{4 \pi d_{\mathrm{L}}^{2}},
\]  
where \(d_{\mathrm{L}}\) denotes the luminosity distance and a spectral index of \(\alpha=0.3\) is assumed for the redshift correction into bands relevant for upcoming observatories like ngVLA and SKA. In parallel, the radio emission from the host galaxies is modeled by considering two principal processes: thermal bremsstrahlung from H II regions and synchrotron emission from supernova remnants. An empirical relation from Delhaize et al. (2017) is adopted, incorporating a redshift dependence and an assumed IMF factor \(f_{IMF}=1.7\). The stellar flux is derived via  
\[
f_{\nu_{\text{obs}}} = \frac{L_{R}(1+z)^{\alpha+1}}{4 \pi d_{\mathrm{L}}^{2}}\left(\frac{1.4}{\nu_{\text{obs}}}\right)^{\alpha},
\]  
with \(\alpha=0.7\) and observing frequencies of 3 GHz and 8 GHz. Star formation rates (SFRs) in the host galaxies are bracketed at 1, 10, and \(30 \, M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\) to account for uncertainties and model degeneracies.","The analysis reveals distinct behaviors of the AGN-to-SFR radio flux ratios under different scenarios and SFR conditions. In the standard scenario at \(z=7\), the flux ratio for an SFR of \(1 \, M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\) spans 0.1–40. Here, AGN fluxes generally dominate across a range of \(M_{\mathrm{BH}}\) and \(L_{\mathrm{X}}\) values, although the lowest AGN fluxes only outshine host emissions when \(M_{\mathrm{BH}}>10^{6.5} \, M_{\odot}\) and \(L_{\mathrm{X}} \geq 10^{43.5} \, \mathrm{erg \, s}^{-1}\). For higher SFRs of \(10 \, M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\) and \(30 \, M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\), the flux ratios decrease to 0.02–4 and 0.002–2, respectively, with host emissions becoming dominant except under extreme BH mass and X-ray luminosity conditions. AGN radio fluxes are predicted in the range of 1–3000 nJy, with a general decline toward higher redshifts, while the host galaxy fluxes vary between 10 and 1000 nJy depending on the SFR. In the scenario where radio-loudness is introduced, a significant enhancement of the flux ratios occurs; for example, at an SFR of \(1 \, M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\), ratios increase to values between 5 and 2000, and AGN fluxes are substantially more dominant. Under this scenario, radio-loud AGN fluxes are estimated between 20,000 to 2,000,000 nJy compared to 90–4000 nJy for radio-quiet cases. Observational prospects indicate that most AGN fluxes in LRDs should be detectable by ngVLA with a 10-hour integration over the redshift range \(3<z<7\), while SKA would need about 100-hour integrations. Signals exceeding approximately 2000 nJy at \(z=3-4\) or around 500 nJy at \(z>5\) would strongly support the identification of AGN in LRDs, assuming an intermediate SFR of \(10 \, M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\). Current surveys such as VLASS, FIRST, and COSMOS have not detected radio-loud LRDs, aligning with the notion that they are predominantly radio-quiet.","The comparative analysis between the standard and radio-loudness scenarios provides compelling insights into the nature of LRDs. In the standard scenario, the dominance of AGN radio emission over host galaxy emission is largely dependent on achieving low SFRs or exceptionally high \(M_{\mathrm{BH}}\) and \(L_{\mathrm{X}}\) values. The progressive decrease in AGN radio fluxes with increasing redshift further complicates detection efforts. Conversely, in the radio-loudness scenario, AGN radio fluxes are enhanced by approximately two orders of magnitude, rendering them easily detectable even when embedded within hosts with high star formation rates. Despite this, the lack of observed radio-loud LRDs in current radio surveys suggests that the LRD population is more consistent with radio-quiet AGN. These findings support the hypothesis that LRDs are dust-reddened AGN, potentially operating at super-Eddington rates, where radio emission remains relatively unaffected by significant obscuration.","The study’s outcomes have significant implications for our understanding of early black hole growth and galaxy evolution. The apparent radio-quiet nature of LRDs implies that any future confirmation of their AGN activity could fundamentally influence theories regarding AGN feedback mechanisms, BH seeding, and cosmic reionization processes. With upcoming facilities such as ngVLA and SKA poised to achieve the required sensitivity (down to 10 nJy levels), targeted radio observations of LRDs will be crucial. Such investigations will not only validate the estimated radio emission models but also provide deeper insights into the coevolution of galaxies and AGN in the early universe, potentially necessitating revisions to current models of high-redshift galaxy formation and evolution."
2502.03941,Gaps in stellar streams as a result of globular cluster fly‐bys: The case of Palomar 5-PREPRINT,Salvatore Ferrone et al.,"Stellar streams are elongated structures formed by the tidal disruption of globular clusters or dwarf galaxies. Their extended tails, as exemplified by Palomar 5’s stream which extends over 20 degrees, serve as tracers of the Galaxy’s gravitational potential. Early predictions of tidal tails emerged in the 1970s, with observational confirmations arriving in the 1990s through discoveries like the Sagittarius stream and Palomar 5’s tails. Advances from surveys, including SDSS, Pan-STARRS, and Gaia, have unveiled dozens of such streams, enabling detailed orbital and chemical analyses. These streams have been pivotal in characterizing the Milky Way’s gravitational field, where studies have revealed both triaxial and spherical halo shapes at different distances. In addition, gaps within these streams have traditionally been attributed to interactions with dark matter sub-halos predicted by \(\Lambda\)CDM models, although recent considerations have underscored that baryonic structures and components may also play an influential role.","Recent investigations have prompted a reassessment of the long-held view that globular cluster encounters have a negligible impact on stellar streams. In inner regions of the Galaxy, where cluster densities are higher, interactions may be frequent. Motivated by findings such as those of Ishchenko et al. (2023b), who pointed out that collisions with clusters are plausible, this work seeks to quantify the effects of 165 Galactic globular clusters on Palomar 5’s stream. The objective is to explore whether globular clusters, as baryonic perturbers, can induce observable gaps in the stellar stream, thereby challenging previous interpretations that solely blamed dark matter sub-halos and other baryonic features like the Galactic bar or giant molecular clouds.","The study models Palomar 5’s stream using a combination of the restricted three-body problem and mutual \(N\)-body interactions to capture the physics of both the Galactic potential and cluster fly-bys. The initial conditions for 165 Galactic clusters were taken from the work of Baumgardt & Vasiliev (2021) and converted to a Galactocentric frame. A time-independent Galactic potential from Pouliasis et al. (2017) was employed over a 5 Gyr period. In addition to the restricted three-body treatment, the research extends previous work by representing each globular cluster as a Plummer sphere with assigned masses and radii, with backward integration for 5 Gyr to establish initial positions and velocities. Forward integration then simulated Palomar 5’s evolution using 100,000 particles with a leapfrog integrator and a time-step of 10,000 years to ensure numerical accuracy. Monte Carlo sampling was used across 50 simulation realizations to handle uncertainties in cluster properties, providing intermediate snapshots at 1 Myr intervals. Detailed specifications include the derivation of the gap creation rate, where the simulations yielded \(\mathcal{R}_{\text{Pal 5}} = 0.009 \, \text{km s}^{-1} \text{kpc}^{-2}\), and the calculation of momentum change during encounters given by  
\[
\Delta p \approx 2 \frac{GM}{b \delta v},
\]
where \(M\) represents the mass of the perturber, \(b\) is the impact parameter, and \(\delta v\) is the relative velocity. These simulations carefully monitored key parameters such as impact parameters (with gaps forming predominantly for \(b < 200\) pc and disappearing for \(b > 300\) pc), mass, and relative velocity, as well as the momentum exchange that drives gap formation.","The simulations demonstrate that globular clusters have a significant and observable impact on the density profile of Palomar 5’s stream. A total of 73 gaps were identified over 50 simulation runs, yielding an average of 1.5 gaps per simulation. Notably, clusters such as NGC 2808, NGC 7078, and NGC 104 were found to be the primary culprits, with NGC 2808 emerging as the most frequent perturber after an encounter approximately 200 Myr ago. When NGC 2808 was excluded, the average dropped to 0.6 gaps per simulation. These gaps also exhibit a dependence on their location along the stream, with a greater concentration in the leading tail compared to the trailing tail. Analysis of the density peaks, while overestimated in some instances due to modeling assumptions, still robustly reflected the complex mass-loss dynamics of Palomar 5. Additionally, detailed examinations of the impact parameters and momentum changes revealed that gap-producing flybys impart a momentum change roughly ten times larger than encounters that do not produce significant gaps.","The observations from the simulations indicate that the role of globular clusters in shaping the morphology of Palomar 5’s stellar stream is far from negligible. The creation of gaps due to close fly-bys, particularly at impact parameters below 200 pc, reinforces the idea that baryonic mechanisms can mimic or even overshadow the effects attributed solely to dark matter sub-halo interactions. The uniform presence of gaps at various orbital phases and the declining frequency with increasing galactocentric radius suggest that the local density of globular clusters near the inner Galaxy may be a more dominant factor in gap formation than previously appreciated. Moreover, the results, which detail the momentum changes and the conditions under which gaps are formed, provide crucial insights into the dynamical processes governing stream evolution over gigayear timescales.","This study challenges the conventional narrative that dark matter sub-halos are the exclusive drivers of gap formation in stellar streams. By illustrating that globular clusters can induce gaps in Palomar 5’s stream, particularly in the inner regions of the Galaxy where baryonic structures are densely populated, the findings imply that interpretations of stream gaps in terms of dark matter must account for competing baryonic effects. These results call for revised models in future studies of the Milky Way’s potential and a more integrated consideration of both baryonic and dark matter influences. Continued work that incorporates evolving Galactic potentials and historical changes in globular cluster populations will be essential in refining our understanding of the complex processes governing stellar stream morphology."
2502.04211,Exploring the limits of nucleonic metamodelling using different relativistic density functionals,Prasanta Char et al.,"Neutron stars provide a unique laboratory for probing matter at densities several times that of nuclear saturation density, \(n_{\text{sat}}\). The equation of state (EOS) governing neutron star matter is still uncertain despite constraints emerging from radio observations of massive pulsars, the multimessenger event GW170817, and X-ray measurements by NICER. Direct calculations using quantum chromodynamics (QCD) remain impractical because of strong coupling under these conditions, leading researchers to favor effective field theories such as relativistic mean-field (RMF) models. These RMF models, which incorporate density-dependent meson-baryon couplings, have been successful in describing both nuclear matter and finite nuclei properties for decades. In this context, two classes of density-dependent RMF models—the Typel-Wolter (TW) and Gogelein et al. (GDFM) formulations—are used to represent the nucleonic interactions at high densities.","The study is driven by the need to understand how different relativistic density functionals predict the proton fraction and overall composition of neutron star matter, especially at high densities. Previous investigations have noted that composition information tends to be obscured in \(\beta\)-equilibrium, which complicates the inference of properties such as the symmetry energy and associated higher-order parameters. This uncertainty motivates the application of a nucleonic metamodelling approach in order to generate a large ensemble of models that systematically explore the parameter space. The aim is to reveal differences in predictions between models that otherwise yield similar EOS and neutron star mass–radius sequences, and to highlight the importance of non-equilibrium observations in providing explicit symmetry energy information.","A metamodelling approach is adopted to generate an extensive ensemble of models based on two specific density-dependent RMF formulations: TW and GDFM. In the TW model, the density-dependent couplings are expressed as  
\[
\Gamma_i(n_B) = \Gamma_i(n_{\text{sat}})f_i(x),
\]  
where \(f_i(x)\) is a rational function and \(x = n_B/n_0\), while in the GDFM model the coupling takes the form  
\[
\Gamma_i(n_B) = a_i + \left(b_i + d_i x^3\right)e^{-c_i x}.
\]  
Parameters such as \(n_{\text{sat}}\), \(E_{\text{sat}}\), \(K_{\text{sat}}\), \(E_{\text{sym}}\), and \(L_{\text{sym}}\) are strictly constrained within specific ranges based on nuclear empirical properties. To systematically explore these models and incorporate both nuclear and astrophysical constraints, a Bayesian analysis is performed using Nested Sampling, as implemented in PyMultiNest. This analysis involves first generating the likelihood for nuclear matter properties (NMPs) at saturation using independent Gaussian distributions at discrete density points, followed by constructing unified equations of state that span from the neutron star crust to its core. The crust is modeled using a compressible liquid drop approach with nonrelativistic metamodeling that is matched seamlessly with the relativistic core. The study further incorporates astrophysical constraints derived from pulsar mass measurements and GW170817 by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, with the likelihoods updated via Bayes theorem. All mathematical expressions are carefully formatted, ensuring that critical relationships such as \(E = mc^2\) and other detailed expressions for coupling functions and parameter ranges are properly represented in LaTeX.","Both the TW and GDFM models yield similar overall equations of state and neutron star mass–radius sequences when subjected to the metamodelling and Bayesian analysis protocols. However, significant differences emerge in the underlying composition, particularly in the predicted proton fractions at high densities. While TW exhibits a saturation of proton fractions between 0.12 and 0.2 at high densities, GDFM demonstrates much greater isovector freedom, producing prior proton fractions up to approximately 0.45 and posterior values around 0.3. Key isoscalar parameters such as \(E_{\text{sat}}\), \(n_{\text{sat}}\), and \(K_{\text{sat}}\) remain largely unaffected by astrophysical constraints, although higher-order parameters like \(Q_{\text{sat}}^{*}\) and \(Z_{sat}^{*}\) show marked differences between the models, with GDFM avoiding large negative \(Q_{sat}^{*}\) values and featuring a broader range for \(Z_{sat}^{*}\). In the isovector sector, parameters including \(E_{\text{sym}}\) and its derivatives display similar trends for both formulations, while higher-order parameters such as \(L_{\text{sym}}\), \(K_{\text{sym}}\), \(Q_{sym}^{*}\), and \(Z_{sym}^{*}\) are significantly influenced by the imposed constraints. The analysis of Pearson correlation coefficients further reveals distinct patterns in the correlations of nuclear matter parameters, with TW showing a smoother trend in the speed of sound and systematically higher energy per particle for symmetric nuclear matter, in contrast to GDFM's rapid increase and saturation. These results are consistent across mass–radius and mass–tidal deformability sequences, with both models aligning with NICER observational constraints, yet still diverging in subtle aspects of high-density behavior.","The study's findings indicate that although both RMF models produce neutron star configurations in accordance with modern observational constraints, significant differences in the predicted high-density composition persist, particularly in terms of proton fraction and higher-order isovector parameters. The divergence between TW and GDFM is attributed to their inherent parametric freedom in the meson-baryon coupling, notably the isovector \(\rho\)-meson sector. These differences illustrate that while \(\beta\)-equilibrated EOS conditions are effective in constraining macroscopic observables such as mass and radius, they are insufficient to fully determine the microphysical composition of neutron star matter. The correlations observed in higher-order parameters and the distinct trends in variables like the speed of sound further underscore the influence of the underlying Lagrangian structure, which in turn may impact transport properties and cooling behaviors in neutron stars.","The broader implication of this work is that a comprehensive understanding of neutron star matter requires explicit constraints on the symmetry energy, beyond what is obtainable from \(\beta\)-equilibrated equations of state alone. The demonstrated variability in proton fraction and higher-order parameter predictions between TW and GDFM models emphasizes the need for non-equilibrium observational data to resolve ambiguities in nuclear composition. This study not only reinforces the importance of incorporating both nuclear and astrophysical constraints through advanced Bayesian techniques but also paves the way for enhanced inference strategies, such as machine learning-based EOS determinations. Ultimately, the insights gained here have significant implications for predicting neutron star cooling, transport phenomena, and the overall behavior of ultra-dense matter under extreme astrophysical conditions."
2502.04264,Fundamental Oscillation Modes in Neutron Stars with Hyperons and Delta Baryons,O. P. Jyothilakshmi et al.,"Neutron stars (NSs) are complex astrophysical objects whose interiors may host exotic particles such as hyperons and delta (\(\Delta\)) baryons. Recent advances in gravitational wave (GW) astronomy, particularly following GW detections from binary neutron star mergers, have provided new avenues to probe the dense matter equation of state (EoS). In this context, oscillation modes—especially the fundamental or \(f\)-modes—play a critical role because their associated GW emissions can be observed with current and upcoming detectors like LIGO,VIRGO, and the Einstein Telescope. The study builds on established theories of NS oscillations using relativistic models and incorporates a modified effective chiral model that successfully describes finite-temperature and low-density matter, now extended to include hyperon octets and \(\Delta\) baryons.","The investigation is motivated by the need to understand how the inclusion of exotic particles such as hyperons and \(\Delta\) baryons influences the stiffness of the NS equation of state and, consequently, the observable properties such as \(f\)-mode oscillation frequencies and tidal deformability \(\Lambda\). Observational constraints from pulsar data and GW events urge a careful re-examination of the role of these particles in NS interiors. The study aims to address the softening effects induced by hyperons while simultaneously exploring how delta baryons might yield stiffer EoSs that satisfy the mass constraints from pulsars like PSR J0348+0432, PSR J0740+6620, and observations from GW170817.","A modified effective chiral model is employed to construct the equations of state for both hyperon-rich and delta baryon matter. In this framework, nucleons interact via mesons including pseudo-scalar (\(\pi\)), scalar (\(\sigma\)), iso-vector (\(\rho\)), and vector (\(\omega\)) particles, with higher-order mesonic interactions and cross-couplings—parameterized by quantities such as \(\eta_{1}\)—accounting for the density-dependent symmetry energy behavior. The methodology computes NS structure by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, and the relativistic Cowling approximation is then applied to analyze non-radial \(f\)-mode oscillations by solving coupled differential equations for perturbation functions \(V(r)\) and \(W(r)\). Boundary conditions at the center and surface, alongside iterative methods like Ridders’s technique for eigenfrequency determination, ensure robustness. Additional differential equations yield the Love number \(k_{2}\), which is used to calculate the tidal deformability \(\Lambda\) through its dependence on NS radius \(R\) and compactness \(C=M/R\).","The analysis reveals that the \(\Delta\) EoS is stiffer than the hyperon-rich (\(H\)) EoS, a difference that becomes pronounced in high-mass NSs. Specifically, for high masses the \(f\)-mode frequencies differ significantly between the two cases, with \(l=2\) mode frequencies being approximately 2.42 kHz for the hyperon EoS and 2.39 kHz for the delta baryon EoS. Mass-radius profiles derived from the TOV equations show maximum masses of \(2.03 M_{\odot}\) for hyperonic matter and \(2.20 M_{\odot}\) for delta matter, with corresponding radii of about 12.11 km and 12.26 km, respectively, and canonical \(1.4 M_{\odot}\) NS radii around 13.3 km. The speed of sound \(c_s^2\) in the \(\Delta\) EoS exceeds the conformal limit \(c_s^2=1/3\) beyond twice the saturation density \(\rho_0\), while the hyperonic EoS approaches this limit. Additionally, tidal deformability \(\Lambda\) is noted to be lower for the delta baryon scenario (with \(\Lambda \approx 17.8\) at maximum mass) compared to hyperon-rich matter (\(\Lambda \approx 30.5\)), and an empirical linear relation \(f(\mathrm{kHz}) \approx 1.148 + 1.358 \sqrt{\tilde{M}/\tilde{R}^{3}}\) is established to relate \(f\)-mode frequencies with NS mass and radius.","The differences observed in the \(f\)-mode oscillation frequencies and overall NS structural properties underscore the impact of exotic matter in the stellar interior. The stiffer character of the \(\Delta\) EoS leads to higher maximum masses and compactness compared to hyperon-rich matter, a phenomenon that mirrors the observational trends noted in pulsar and GW data. The successful application of the Cowling approximation—with less than 20% difference compared to full general relativistic treatments—validates its use in efficiently predicting oscillation frequencies. Empirical relations derived from the analysis further establish a connection between the internal composition, as determined by the EoS, and the NS oscillation spectrum, thereby providing a framework to potentially constrain these models with future GW measurements.","The findings have significant implications for the ongoing effort to decode the dense matter equation of state in neutron stars. The distinct signatures in the \(f\)-mode frequencies and tidal deformability for NSs containing hyperons versus \(\Delta\) baryons provide promising observables for upcoming GW observations. As more precise measurements become available, they will enable tighter constraints on the nature of exotic matter and the interplay of mesonic interactions at supranuclear densities, thereby enriching our understanding of NS interiors and the fundamental physics governing compact objects."
2502.03977,Performance Analysis of Digital Flux-locked Loop Circuit with Different SQUID \(V-\phi\) Transfer Curves for TES Readout System*,Nan Li et al.,"Superconducting transition-edge sensors (TES) are ultra-low-noise detectors capable of achieving energy resolutions on the order of several to tens of \(\mathrm{eV}\). These detectors rely on low-noise direct current superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) to amplify signals with high signal-to-noise ratios. However, due to the inherently nonlinear behavior of SQUIDs, the signals must be linearized using a flux-locked loop (FLL). Digital FLL systems are especially advantageous for their simplified signal manipulation and the extended dynamic range obtained through flux-quanta counting and dynamic field compensation. Such technology finds applications across diverse domains including magnetoencephalogram (MEG), magnetocardiogram (MCG), and cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments.","Despite the widespread use of digital FLL systems, detailed analyses of critical performance parameters such as bandwidth and slew rate remain scarce. The study is motivated by the need to understand the impact of SQUID \(V-\phi\) curve shapes on the performance of digital FLL circuits. Specifically, the research seeks to address how different transfer function models affect the system’s dynamic feedback behavior, stability, and overall signal tracking capability, thereby providing a reliable framework for the design and optimization of advanced SQUID readout systems.","The investigation begins with a simplified digital SQUID-FLL model where the TES current is coupled to the input coil \(L_{in}\) of a single-stage SQUID, transforming the current into a magnetic flux signal \(\phi_{in}\). The nonlinear, quasi-sinusoidal SQUID response is modeled using a sinusoidal approximation expressed as  
\[
u_{err}(t)=A \sin \left(\frac{2 \pi}{\phi_{0}}\left[i_{in}(t) M_{in}-\frac{u_{o}(t) M_{fb}}{R_{fb}}+\phi_{offset}\right]\right) G_{1}+u_{offset},
\]  
where \(\phi_{0}\) is the quantum magnetic flux, \(i_{in}(t)\) represents the TES signal, \(u_{o}(t)\) is the feedback voltage, \(R_{fb}\) is the feedback resistor, and \(G_{1}\) is the preamplifier linear gain. This model is validated through simulations that examine linear amplification, bandwidth, slew rate, and the dynamic response to pulse signals emulating TES outputs. The digital FLL operates via a closed-loop negative flux feedback circuit utilizing operational amplifiers, where the output digital signal is related to the error signal through the circuit equation  
\[
u_{o}(n)=\left(\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}+\frac{C_{1}}{C_{2}}\right) u_{err}(n)+\frac{\Delta t}{R_{1} C_{2}} \sum_{i=0}^{n} u_{err}(i)+\frac{R_{2} C_{1}}{\Delta t}\left[u_{err}(n)-u_{err}(n-1)\right],
\]  
with \(R_{1}\), \(C_{1}\), \(R_{2}\), and \(C_{2}\) denoting the input and feedback resistances and capacitances, \(\Delta t\) the sampling period, and the components corresponding to proportional (\(P\)), integral (\(I\)), and differential (\(D\)) control. Simulation parameters include a 23 Hz triangular wave input, a sampling rate of 150 MSPS with 7 samples per frame, and a feedback frequency around 21.4 MHz. The model also considers practical aspects such as time delays analogous to time-division multiplexing (TDM) logic, the calibration of PID parameters to prevent oscillations, and the impact of adjusting integration parameters and feedback components on system performance.","Simulation results verify that the proposed digital SQUID-FLL model accurately linearizes the inherently nonlinear SQUID response with error signals maintained below \(10 \mu \phi_{0}\) and relative errors under 0.1%. Locking conditions were systematically tested by varying flux and voltage offsets, confirming that the SQUID locking point is achieved when the polarity between the SQUID response \(dV_{SQUID}/d\phi_{in}\) and the amplifier gain is correctly matched. Additionally, the digital FLL demonstrated independence from the specific shape of the SQUID \(V-\phi\) curve, reinforcing its robustness across different transfer function models. Detailed analysis of bandwidth and slew rate revealed that, for a feedback capacitance \(C_{2}=2 \mathrm{nF}\), the theoretical 3 dB bandwidth is given by  
\[
f_{c} \approx \frac{V_{\phi} G_{1} M_{fb}}{2 \pi R_{1} C_{2} R_{fb}},
\]  
yielding approximately 628 kHz as predicted by simulations. Including system delays, the modified bandwidth expression becomes  
\[
f_{c} \approx \frac{V_{\phi} G_{1} M_{fb} N_{sp} t_{sp}}{2 \pi R_{1} C_{2} R_{fb} t_{fm}},
\]  
while the slew rate is quantified by  
\[
\frac{\partial \phi_{fb}}{\partial t}=\frac{\phi_{lin} N_{sp} t_{sp}}{2 R_{1} C_{2} t_{fm}},
\]  
with a simulated value of \(1.5 \phi_{0}/\mu \mathrm{s}\) for \(\phi_{lin} \approx 0.3 \phi_{0}\). The response of the system to X-ray pulse signals with rise times ranging from 4.4 \(\mu \mathrm{s}\) to 281 \(\mu \mathrm{s}\) further substantiated the model’s precise tracking capabilities, with distortion arising only when pulse amplitudes exceeded \(7.8 \phi_{0}\).","The comprehensive simulations indicate that the digital SQUID-FLL design not only provides precise linear amplification and tracking of TES signals but also demonstrates consistent performance irrespective of variations in the SQUID \(V-\phi\) curve shape. The findings underscore the critical interplay between system parameters—such as feedback capacitance, preamplifier gain, and digital sampling rates—in determining the overall bandwidth and slew rate. Additionally, the study confirms that careful calibration of PID parameters is essential to ensure stable locking and minimal error. The observed independence of the FLL performance from the SQUID transfer function shape implies that the design can be widely applied across different SQUID configurations without compromising signal integrity.","The outcomes of this work provide valuable insights for the design and optimization of next-generation SQUID readout systems, particularly for multiplexing applications in TES-based detectors. With parameters such as system bandwidth and slew rate rigorously characterized, the digital FLL design can be tailored to meet the stringent requirements of high-resolution astrophysical observations and X-ray pulse detection. The demonstration of low noise contributions—including minimized ADC/DAC quantization noise—and robust locking irrespective of SQUID \(V-\phi\) curve variations paves the way for developing advanced digital PID flux feedback systems that are critical for precise detector readouts in astrophysics and related fields."
2502.04319,On the origin of the \(\Sigma_{1}\),A. Cattaneo et al.,"The study is set against the backdrop of understanding galaxy quenching processes, where galaxies cease forming stars when the energy output of their central supermassive black holes surpasses a critical threshold—specifically, over 100 times the baryonic gravitational binding energy. The central kiloparsec stellar surface density, \(\Sigma_{1}\), emerges as a significant morphological indicator, with galaxies tending to redden and quench as \(\Sigma_{1}\) rises. The work builds on empirical findings that establish a quenching boundary in the \(\Sigma_{1}-M_{\star}\) plane, asserting a relation of \(\Sigma_{1} \propto M_{\star}^{0.66}\), and links black hole mass \(M_{\bullet}\) to the halo virial mass \(M_{\text{vir}}\) and virial velocity \(v_{\text{vir}}\). In this context, the research revisits galaxy mass functions and morphological transformations, extending the analysis to include both disc and bulge radii while providing a unified view of the pathways leading to passive and star-forming systems.","The primary motivation is to uncover the astrophysical origin behind the observed \(\Sigma_{1}-M_{\star}\) quenching boundary and the \(M_{\bullet}-\Sigma_{1}\) correlation. By exploring a model in which mergers play a crucial role in funneling gas into galactic centres—thereby growing supermassive black holes and triggering morphological transformations—the study aims to explain the dichotomy between high-mass passive galaxies, predominantly produced by black hole feedback, and lower-mass satellites, quenched by environmental effects. Understanding why galaxies transition from blue, star-forming systems to red, passive systems once \(\Sigma_{1}\) crosses a critical threshold and how this transition correlates with the central bulge-to-total ratio \(B/T\) is central to the investigation.","The research employs the GalICS semi-analytic model, initially presented in version 2.2 and later refined in GalICS 2.3, to simulate the complex interplay between mergers, star formation, and feedback processes. Two quenching schemes are considered—one based on halo mass thresholds (Model A) and another on black hole feedback (Model B)—with the latter being adopted in the updated version. In parallel, two approaches for modeling merger-induced morphological transformations are implemented; the first distinguishes sharply between major and minor mergers while the second, guided by hydrodynamic simulations, allows a gradual transition in bulge and black hole growth. The bulge and central cusp are modeled with a single Hernquist profile, and energy conservation is enforced in mergers through the mechanical energy budget, where the stellar kinetic energy \(T_{*}\) and gravitational potential energy \(U_{*}\) (with contributions from dark matter) are linked via the virial theorem, measured by the ratio \(2 T_{*} /|U_{*}|\). In addition, the model differentiates between quiescent disc star formation and bursty cusp or bar star formation, adopting timescales of 1 Gyr and 0.24 Gyr respectively, and calibrating the quiescent star formation rate (SFR) according to  
\[
\mathrm{SFR}=\epsilon_{\mathrm{sf}} \frac{M_{\mathrm{gas}}}{t_{\mathrm{dyn}}} \,,
\]  
where \(\epsilon_{\mathrm{sf}} \sim 1/25\) and \(t_{\mathrm{dyn}}\) is the orbital time. Tidal stripping of satellites is also incorporated following prescriptions that determine the tidal radius \(r_{\mathrm{t}}\), accounting for corrections based on NFW profiles and aligning with the Jacobi limit. Throughout, comparisons are drawn with hydrodynamic simulations as well as observational data from surveys such as CANDELS and SDSS to ensure fidelity in reproducing galaxy mass functions, sizes, and morphological properties over the redshift range \(0<z<2.5\).","The simulations successfully reproduce both star-forming and quiescent galaxy mass functions across a broad redshift interval, specifically \(0.5<z<2.5\), and align well with local observations. The model naturally recovers the \(\Sigma_{1}-M_{\star}\) quenching boundary, confirming that increases in \(\Sigma_{1}\) correlate with a fading of star formation. Analysis of energy conservation in merger events reveals that the assumption \(2 T_{*} /|U_{*}|=1\) introduces an approximate 20% error, which is acceptable given the observed scatter. Comparison between dissipationless and dissipative mergers shows that while the former reproduces galaxy sizes well over the entire redshift range, the latter enhances agreement at \(z>1.5\) at the expense of low-\(z\) accuracy. Additionally, the model distinguishes galaxies by their specific star formation rates (sSFR), successfully separating high-sSFR (blue) from low-sSFR (red) populations. The emergence of passive galaxies, with distinct properties based on whether quenching is driven by black hole feedback or environmental effects, is also reflected in the distinct bimodal mass distributions and trends in \(\Sigma_{1}\).","The results point to a scenario where galaxy quenching is intimately tied to morphological evolution driven by mergers. Mergers promote bulge formation and channel gas into the central regions, triggering supermassive black hole growth that eventually leads to quenching once the energy output exceeds a critical threshold relative to the baryonic binding energy. The observed scaling relations, such as \(\Sigma_{1} \propto M_{\star}^{0.66}\) and the correlations with \(M_{\bullet}\), underscore the link between central galaxy structure and feedback processes. Moreover, the distinction between high-mass, black hole-quenched central galaxies and lower-mass, environmentally quenched satellites is revealed both in the model’s mass functions and in the residual star formation properties. The gradual change in bulge-to-total ratios and the continuing increase in \(\Sigma_{1}\) post-quenching highlight the role of mergers even after star formation has tapered off, reinforcing the picture of a continuous and physically motivated pathway from blue, disc-dominated systems to red, bulge-dominated ellipticals.","The implications of this work are far-reaching, offering a coherent framework for linking morphological evolution with feedback-driven quenching across cosmic time. By validating the model against diverse observational datasets and reproducing key features of galaxy mass functions and structural relations, the study offers a robust explanation for the dichotomy observed in galaxy populations. The findings imply that future surveys targeting high-resolution measurements of bulge properties and central surface densities can effectively discriminate between quenching mechanisms. Furthermore, the work suggests that environmental factors and merger histories must be carefully considered when modeling galaxy evolution, thereby guiding both theoretical and observational strategies in the quest to understand how galaxies transition from vibrant star-forming systems to quiescent spheroids."
2502.04108,Can a secluded self-interacting dark sector generate detectable gravitational waves ?,Song Li et al.,"This work builds on the concept of a hidden dark sector that interacts predominantly with itself and remains largely decoupled from the visible sector. The study is grounded in the framework of a dark \(U(1)'\) gauge symmetry, which is spontaneously broken via a dark Higgs mechanism. This breaking generates masses for dark matter (\(\chi\)), the dark Higgs (\(S\)), and the dark photon (\(A'\)), while nearly massless dark radiation (\(\psi\)) plays a crucial role in preventing an overclosure of the universe. The dark sector is thus not only responsible for addressing small-scale structure issues but also for providing an arena where novel cosmological phenomena, such as dark acoustic oscillations (DAO) and self-interactions of dark matter, can take place. Cosmological observables, including constraints on the effective number of neutrinos (\(N_{\rm eff}\)) from Planck and BAO data, as well as Lyman-\(\alpha\) observations, set key boundaries on the dynamics and temperature evolution of this secluded sector.","The primary motivation behind the study is to explore whether gravitational waves (GWs) originating from a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in such a secluded, self-interacting dark sector might be detectable by future GW observatories such as SKA or LISA. By addressing small-scale structure issues with self-interacting dark matter and incorporating a nearly massless dark radiation component, the model aims to reconcile discrepancies observed in galactic scales. At the same time, the possibility of generating stochastic GWs through a dark sector FOPT provides an exciting potential observable signal, despite stringent constraints imposed by cosmological data which may suppress such signals.","The analysis follows a multi-step approach that begins with establishing a detailed dark sector model based on a spontaneously broken \(U(1)'\) gauge symmetry. The Lagrangian \(\mathcal{L}_{\rm Dark}\) includes the terms for the dark matter particle \(\chi\), dark Higgs \(S\), and dark radiation \(\psi\), with the scalar potential \(V(S,\psi)\) designed to produce the necessary mass hierarchy (such as \(m_\psi^2 \ll (0.1\text{ eV})^2\) to ensure \(\psi\) behaves as radiation). The study further models the thermal history of the dark sector, where at high reheating temperatures (\(T'_{\rm reh} \gg m_\chi\)) particles are initially relativistic before the dark matter becomes non-relativistic and undergoes freeze-out via the process \(\chi\bar{\chi} \rightarrow A'A'\). An asymmetry defined as \(Y_{\Delta\chi} \equiv Y_\chi - Y_{\bar{\chi}}\) is also introduced to enlarge the viable parameter space. A comprehensive parameter scan over \(\{m_\chi, m_{A'}, \alpha', m_s, \xi_{\rm reh}\}\) is performed, with detailed numerical ranges—for instance, \(10\,{\rm GeV} < m_\chi < 600\,{\rm GeV}\) and \(0.1\,{\rm MeV} < m_{A'} < 10\,{\rm MeV}\). In parallel, the gravitational wave signals from the FOPT are computed by combining contributions from bubble collisions, sound waves, and turbulence. This includes a careful treatment of the thermal effective potential \(V(\phi,T)\), which incorporates tree-level, one-loop, thermal, and daisy resummation effects, along with key parameters such as the percolation temperature \(T_{\rm perc}\), transition strength \(\mathbb{A}\), duration described by \(\beta/H_*\), and the bubble wall velocity \(v_w\).","The analysis reveals that the parameter space is highly restricted by numerous constraints. The scan shows that regions with suitable dark matter self-scattering cross-sections, consistent DAO effects from DM-DR scattering, and acceptable contributions to \(\Delta N_{\rm eff} = \frac{8}{7}\left(\frac{4}{11}\right)^{-4/3}\xi_\infty^4\) are achieved only within a narrow range of parameters. In particular, although gravitational wave peak amplitudes \(h^2\Omega_{\rm GW}^{\rm peak}\) could in principle reach up to \(10^{-7}\) for favorable choices of parameters—primarily determined by the combination \(\alpha' \frac{m_{A'}^2}{m_s^2}\) and the temperature ratio \(\xi_{\rm reh}\)—stringent bounds from Lyman-\(\alpha\), \(\Delta N_{\rm eff}\), and DM-DR interactions suppress the GW signal by over four orders of magnitude in realistic scenarios. Additional requirements from dark matter self-interaction measurements across astronomical systems further tighten the viable range of parameters. The study also presents detailed considerations for different scattering regimes (Born, classical, quantum, semi-classical) and employs thermal averaging techniques such as \(\bar{\sigma} \equiv \langle \sigma_V v_{\rm rel}^3 \rangle/(24\sqrt{\pi}v_0^3)\).","The findings suggest that while the secluded self-interacting dark sector model offers a coherent framework to address small-scale structure problems and has interesting theoretical appeal, the practical prospects for detecting gravitational waves from its phase transitions appear bleak under current cosmological constraints. The combination of large parameter space compression from astrophysical observations and the stringent limits from \(\Delta N_{\rm eff}\) and Lyman-\(\alpha\) data indicate that the effective gravitational wave amplitude is too low to be accessible by near-future experiments like SKA or LISA. These theoretical outcomes underscore the challenges inherent in translating rich dark sector dynamics into observable gravitational signals.","The implications of this study extend beyond just the search for gravitational waves. The work emphasizes the need for further refinement in understanding the interplay between dark matter self-interactions, dark radiation contributions, and the dynamics of first-order phase transitions within secluded dark sectors. While the expected signals remain below the detection thresholds of current observatories, the analysis points to critical avenues for future work—both in improving theoretical models (such as reducing uncertainties in GW calculations) and in exploring alternative observational strategies that might indirectly probe such dark sector phenomena. Ultimately, this research provides a robust theoretical foundation that challenges experimentalists to develop more sensitive techniques for detecting subtle imprints of hidden sectors on cosmological observables."
2502.03831,Optimizing Bayesian model selection for equation of state of cold neutron stars,Rahul Kashyap et al.,"Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened a unique window into the study of neutron star interiors by probing the equation of state (EOS) of cold dense matter. The tidal deformability \( \Lambda \) measured from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers is linked to the EOS through the pressure–energy density (\( p-\epsilon \)) and \( \Lambda \)-mass (\( \Lambda-m \)) relations. The signals from BNS mergers, where both the masses and tidal deformabilities are imprinted on the GW waveform, offer the potential to elucidate the physics of dense nucleonic matter. This research is set against the backdrop of multi-messenger observations including insights from NICER and X-ray data, which, in tandem with GW analyses, are pushing our understanding of neutron-rich dense matter and possible QCD phase transitions. Moreover, next-generation detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer are anticipated to substantially enhance sensitivity and extend detection horizons, further refining our ability to constrain the neutron star EOS.","The drive behind this work is to overcome biases and uncertainties introduced by noise and prior assumptions when inferring the EOS from GW data. Traditional approaches face challenges due to the intrinsic correlations and limitations of parameterized waveform models, leading to systematic errors when extrapolating from single events. BEOMS was developed as a Bayesian framework capable of dissociating the macroscopic \(\mathrm{m}-\Lambda\) information from microscopic EOS details in an EOS-agnostic manner. This approach is motivated by the need for a robust multi-event analysis that minimizes uncertainties, leverages the power of cumulative evidence, and ultimately requires fewer events for accurate model selection. The optimization of Bayesian model selection also addresses the need to incorporate Occam's penalty and the effects of EOS-dependent mass limits, thereby enhancing the overall selection efficiency under realistic detector conditions.","The BEOMS framework employs advanced Bayesian methods to evaluate EOS models in the mass–tidal deformability space using GW data from BNS mergers. The methodology begins with EOS-agnostic parameter estimation (PE) results, where the full four-dimensional posterior distribution \(\mathrm{p}(m_1, \Lambda_1, m_2, \Lambda_2)\) is computed using data from simulated inspiral signals generated by the IMRPhenomPv2_NRTidalv2 waveform model. To ensure computational efficiency, these high-dimensional posteriors are transformed and marginalized into two- and three-dimensional spaces. The tidal deformability information is linked to the EOS through Dirac-delta functions enforcing the \( \Lambda-m \) relation, with special care taken in regions near the maximum mass where samples beyond this limit are excluded. In parallel, Bayesian evidence for each EOS hypothesis \( \mathrm{H}_k \) is calculated by integrating over these reduced parameter spaces, with the evidence under general relativity, \( \mathrm{Z}_{\mathrm{GR}} \), derived from the full integration over the EOS-agnostic space. PE is performed in zero noise using relative binning in Bilby, approximating the likelihood as piecewise linear in the frequency domain. Simulated BNS systems adopt a double Gaussian distribution for component masses (with \(\mu=1.35\,\mathrm{M}_\odot, \sigma=0.08\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\) and \(\mu=1.8\,\mathrm{M}_\odot, \sigma=0.3\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\)), uniform NS spins in \([-0.05, 0.05]\), and sources distributed uniformly in comoving volume up to 450 Mpc (\(z\approx 0.1\)). Priors on tidal deformabilities are set uniformly in the range \([0,5000]\), with additional sampling of \(\tilde{\Lambda}\) and \(\delta\tilde{\Lambda}\) to capture the nuances of the constrained parameter spaces.","Extensive simulations were performed for 100 BNS events per EOS (including APR4, DD2, and SLy) using the relative binning technique. These studies indicate that the IMRPhenomNRTidalv2 model, by sampling \(\Lambda_1\) and \(\Lambda_2\) independently while breaking degeneracies through the incorporation of spin-induced quadrupole moments, provides clear evidence for model selection. Analyses with diverse detector networks reveal a marked improvement in sensitivity across configurations: for instance, the O5 network detects 70 out of 100 events, A\# detects 88 events, and the ECC network captures all events, achieving approximately a 100-fold higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to O5. The enhanced precision in measuring the chirp mass and tidal deformability parameters is reflected in the evidence distributions computed in various subspaces such as \(m-\Lambda\) and \((\tilde{\Lambda}, \eta)\). In addition, cumulative evidence calculations and Bayes factor matrices demonstrate that as more events are combined, the correct (injected) EOS consistently dominates, reducing uncertainties and mitigating biases even in the presence of inherent degeneracies between nearby EOS models.","The results underscore the efficacy of the BEOMS framework in robustly distinguishing between different neutron star EOS models using advanced Bayesian model selection methods. By transforming and marginalizing the full posterior distributions into the \(m-\Lambda\) subspace, the analyses reveal that the loss of information from mass ratio data is compensated by the substantial reduction in computational cost and the avoidance of Occam’s penalty. The accumulation of evidence across multiple events effectively suppresses systematic biases and enhances the ability to favor the true EOS, even when faced with degeneracies inherent in similar models. This approach not only validates the potential of using EOS-agnostic PE results but also confirms that subspace evidence calculations can outperform traditional full parameter space methods, particularly for next-generation detectors with significantly higher SNRs.","The success of the BEOMS framework in efficiently determining the EOS from GW data carries profound implications for future astrophysical research and detector design. As current detectors continue to evolve and next-generation networks like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope come online, the methodology outlined here promises to substantially improve the precision of neutron star EOS constraints by leveraging enhanced sensitivity and extended observational horizons. Moreover, the integration of multi-messenger observations will further bridge the gap between gravitational wave and electromagnetic studies, ultimately deepening our understanding of dense matter physics. Future work will aim to incorporate additional complexities such as eccentricity, spin effects, and waveform uncertainties while moving towards population-informed model selection strategies to address potential biases, ensuring that Bayesian inference remains at the forefront of neutron star astrophysics."
2502.03983,Time delay interferometry with minimal null frequencies and shortened time span,Gang Wang et al.,"Time delay interferometry (TDI) is a critical technique for space‐based gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, TAIJI, and TianQian, where it plays a central role in suppressing laser noise. The development of second-generation TDI configurations, including the classic Michelson configuration and the hybrid Relay configuration introduced in previous work, has been fundamental. In these schemes, interferometric observables are created by combining laser links between spacecraft in both forward (\(\rightarrow\)) and backward (\(\leftarrow\)) temporal orders. While the Michelson and hybrid Relay configurations address dynamic spacecraft motions and reduce the impact of laser frequency fluctuations, they have limitations including noise suppression constraints, difficulties in data analysis, and configurations that require longer time delays (up to \(7L\) in the hybrid Relay).","These limitations have motivated the search for a novel TDI configuration that alleviates key issues such as the need for long delays, data margins, frequency aliasing, and extended signal tails. The deficiencies noted in second-generation TDI designs—especially in suppressing null frequencies and achieving robust parameter estimation for high-frequency gravitational waves—served as the impetus for developing PD4L. With its reduced effective delay of \(3L\) (achieved within a total time span of \(4L\) rather than \(8L\) or \(7L\)), PD4L promises minimized null frequencies and improved performance in high-frequency regimes while also addressing challenges in phase coherence and noise stability.","The PD4L configuration is constructed by judiciously combining first-generation TDI configurations such as Beacon and Monitor, thereby reducing the time span to \(4L\) compared to other configurations that require longer delays. In traditional second-generation TDI, specific observables such as \(X1\), \(Y1\), \(Z1\) for the Michelson configuration or \(U\overline{U}\), \(V\overline{V}\), \(W\overline{W}\) in hybrid Relay are derived from four laser links per arm with a maximum delay of \(7L\). PD4L introduces a unique observable scheme, including the PD4L-1 channel that combines \(P(t)\) and \(D(t)\), and establishes observables with minimal null frequencies at \(m/L\) (with \(m=1,2,3,\ldots\)). Orthogonal transformations are applied when the real part of the cross spectral density dominates; in these transformations, channels \(A\) and \(E\) respond to gravitational waves, while channel \(T\) operates as a null stream. Detailed noise budgets are considered in the design, with acceleration noise given by  
\[
\sqrt{S_{\mathrm{acc}}} = 3\,\frac{\mathrm{fm/s}^2}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}} \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{0.4\, \mathrm{mHz}}{f}\right)^2} \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{f}{8\,\mathrm{mHz}}\right)^4}
\]  
and optical metrology system (OMS) noise specified as  
\[
\sqrt{S_{\mathrm{oms}}} = 15\,\frac{\mathrm{pm}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}} \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{2\,\mathrm{mHz}}{f}\right)^4}.
\]  
Furthermore, simulation methodologies were applied to evaluate parameter inference for a chirp signal from a merging massive black hole binary (with \(m_1 = 3 \times 10^4\,M_\odot\), \(m_2 = 10^4\,M_\odot\), and \(z = 0.2\)) as well as for noise characterization. Bayesian inference was used to estimate nine parameters including the redshifted chirp mass \(\mathcal{M}_c\), mass ratio \(q\), and time shift \(\Delta t_c\), and to analyze 12 noise parameters corresponding to the acceleration and OMS noise amplitudes.","The study reveals that PD4L, with its reduced time span of \(4L\), outperforms both the Michelson and hybrid Relay configurations in several critical aspects. PD4L demonstrates fewer null frequencies—specifically at \(u = m\) compared to the Michelson’s null frequencies at \(u = m/4\) (where \(m=1,2,3,\ldots\))—and exhibits significantly smoother gravitational wave (GW) responses at higher frequencies (\(u > 0.1\)). Its null streams, particularly \(\mathrm{T}_{\text{PD4L}}\) and \(C_{3}^{12}\) (with \(C_{3}^{12}\) characterized by a time span of \(2L\)), maintain a robust performance against noise. The noise power spectral densities (PSDs) of the optimal TDI channels show that PD4L has lower noise PSDs at low frequencies due to the shortened time span although it is more sensitive to variations in arm lengths; overall, \(\mathrm{T}_{\text{PD4L}}\) emerges as the most stable among the null streams. Simulation results based on a 3-hour chirp signal moving from 0.01 Hz to 0.3 Hz indicate that PD4L achieves parameter estimates whose true values lie within \(2\sigma\) of the recovered values and exhibits nearly Gaussian marginalized distributions, demonstrating its superior modeling of high-frequency GW signals. Furthermore, noise characterization experiments confirm that PD4L effectively captures acceleration noise parameters, though its estimation of OMS noise parameters shows slight degradation over longer durations.","The analysis of PD4L’s performance underscores its ability to mitigate adverse effects such as high-frequency aliasing, extended signal tails, and excessive data margins, while also managing null frequencies more efficiently than previous TDI schemes. The stability and coherence of the null stream \(\mathrm{T}_{\text{PD4L}}\) provide strong evidence that the configuration can suppress residual laser and clock noise effectively—even with an assumed laser stability of \(30\,\mathrm{Hz}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}\) and clock noise modeled as \(4 \times 10^{-27}/f\) in fractional frequency deviations. The comparative study not only demonstrates PD4L’s improved noise spectra—owing also to its reduced sensitivity to arm length variations—but also illustrates its high-frequency response advantages when processing signals from astrophysical sources such as merging massive black hole binaries. Additionally, the implementation of orthogonal transformations based on the dominance of the real part of the cross spectral density validates the robust design of PD4L’s channel configuration.","The implications of introducing PD4L are significant for the field of gravitational wave astronomy. Its enhanced high-frequency processing capability, resulting from a shorter effective time span and minimized null frequencies, makes it particularly suitable for future space-based gravitational wave missions. The improved performance in parameter inference, noise suppression, and phase coherency suggests that PD4L could lead to better signal modeling and more accurate astrophysical observations. These advancements not only promise to enhance the sensitivity and reliability of gravitational wave detection but also provide a framework for mitigating systematic biases inherent in longer-span TDI configurations. Future work will likely explore correlations between PD4L and other configurations, paving the way for further refinements in TDI strategies and their applications in astrophysical research and cosmological exploration."
2502.03759,Drone Beam Mapping of the TONE Radio Dish Array,Emily R. Kuhn et al.,"The calibration of 21 cm cosmology telescopes is a challenging endeavor, particularly when it comes to accurately mapping beam patterns and removing strong foreground signals. Traditional celestial calibration methods are often hindered by issues such as polarization leakage and dish deformations. Against this backdrop, the application of drone-based beam calibration emerges as a promising alternative, offering the potential to produce high-resolution two-dimensional co- and cross-polarized beam maps over the 400–800 MHz frequency band. The TONE array, a CHIME/FRB outrigger pathfinder composed of eight 6 m dishes equipped with CHIME or HIRAX feeds, serves as an ideal testbed for advancing these calibration techniques.","The primary motivation for this work is to address the limitations inherent in conventional calibration methods by leveraging a drone’s mobility and precision to create detailed beam maps. Accurate knowledge of beam shapes and their polarization characteristics is critical for improving foreground removal in 21 cm cosmology experiments. By developing a system capable of mapping the entire beam over a substantial frequency range, the researchers aim to illuminate systematic effects such as polarization leakage, axes rotation, and misalignment between simulations and on-sky measurements. This approach not only paves the way for enhanced calibration of current instruments but also informs future feed design improvements for telescopes like CHIME and HIRAX.","The study employs a DJI Matrice 600 Pro drone outfitted with a broadband calibration payload that operates between 400 and 800 MHz. This payload incorporates a noise source, an RF switch, and a biconical antenna, and is supported by a UBlox RTK GPS system and an RTK ground station to ensure high positional accuracy during approximately 20–30 minute flights at an altitude of ~200 m. Flight plans executed via UgCS software, along with telemetry data processed using DatCon, allowed for precise beam mapping with a switched calibration signal generated at a cadence of 200 ms. The calibration signal features a 400 ms pulsed white-noise with a 50% duty cycle, and its identification in the auto-correlation data is achieved by iteratively fitting a square wave \(S(t)\). Background subtraction is performed by computing a rolling average of 20 background points and applying the relation \(P_{\text{drone}} = P_{\text{meas}} - \hat{P}_{\mathrm{bkg}}\), while timing corrections of up to 4.5 s are applied through iterative 2D Gaussian fits of the form","\[
G(x,y)= A e^{-\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\sigma_x^2} - \frac{(y-y_0)^2}{2\sigma_y^2}} + C.
\]","Data from a series of flight campaigns in August and October 2021 were gridded in both Cartesian (with uniform 2 m spacing spanning \(-80\) to \(80\) m) and polar coordinates, with pixels adjusted as needed to account for non-uniform areas in the polar case. Normalization across flights was made using the first sidelobe region as a reference, and coadding was performed by polarization after masking regions affected by ADC saturation or low signal-to-noise. Detailed instrument performance characterization included assessments of the dynamic range (with source amplitude variation less than 3%, though occasional 6–8% fluctuations were noted), stability of the biconical antenna beam, and the drone’s minimal RFI impact.","# Results
The drone measurements yielded high-resolution beam maps for four TONE array dishes at 125 frequencies across the 400–800 MHz band. The resulting 2D maps reveal a central main beam with full width at half maximum (FWHM) values varying from about 8.5° to 6° between 450 and 600 MHz, accompanied by two discernible sidelobes at approximately 12° and 25° (measured at roughly –20 dB and –25 dB, respectively). The system achieved statistical errors of 7–9% in the main beam region and 9% in the first sidelobe, although errors increased to around 70% in the second sidelobe. The measurements also exposed significant polarization leakage and axis rotation, particularly above 600 MHz, with cross-polarized beam levels ranging between –23.5 dB and –12.5 dB relative to co-polarized peaks. Notable discrepancies arose when comparing data acquired from fixed versus rotating drone polarization; for instance, polarization rotations showed deviations from idealized orthogonality, especially in HIRAX feeds at higher frequencies, with phase differences dropping to around \(50^{\circ}\) from the expected \(90^{\circ}\). Additionally, beam maps demonstrated an asymmetric dip between the main beam and first sidelobe, while the bicolog transmitter’s \(50^{\circ}\) FWHM caused a suppression effect of 14% (–0.7 dB) at the first sidelobe and 47% (–2.8 dB) at the second. Co-adding procedures produced maps with high-quality frequency retention after visual inspection, with 125 frequencies ultimately selected from the analysis of 12 flights (selected out of 48 due to various technical and quality factors)."
2502.04212,The DESI 2024 hint for dynamical dark energy is biased by low-redshift supernovae,First Author et al.,"The standard \( \Lambda \)CDM model has long been celebrated for its ability to describe cosmological observations; however, persistent tensions—most notably the \(\sim 5 \sigma\) Hubble tension and \(\sim 3 \sigma\) \(S_{8}\) tension—have raised questions about possible new physics. Against this backdrop, recent analyses by the DESI collaboration, when combined with DESY5 supernova (SN) data, suggested a \(\sim 3.9 \sigma\) preference for dynamical dark energy. This apparent deviation from \( \Lambda \)CDM has incited vigorous debate, as issues of data consistency emerge when comparing DES measurements with previous surveys such as SDSS BAO and PantheonPlus.","The study is driven by the need to resolve whether the reported \(\sim 3.9 \sigma\) indication for dynamical dark energy truly reflects new physics or is instead an artifact of systematic uncertainties. A particular focus is placed on the impact of an external low-redshift (low-\(z\)) SN sample in combination with the DES-SN data from DESY5. Observed discrepancies in the intercept \(a_{B}\) of the SN magnitude–redshift relation, specifically a \(\sim 0.043\) magnitude offset between low-\(z\) and DES-SN samples, have raised the possibility that the strong signal for dynamical dark energy may be biased by calibration errors or incorrect sample selection.","To diagnose the origin of the apparent dynamical dark energy preference, the analysis employs a comprehensive data set that includes DESI BAO measurements, DESY5 SN data, SDSS eBOSS BAO, PantheonPlus supernovae, and Planck CMB observations. The methodology centers on analyzing standardized apparent magnitudes \( m_{B}^{\text{corr}} \) and reconstructing the magnitude–redshift relation for both the low-\(z\) and DES-SN samples. A key diagnostic is the sensitivity of the intercept \(-5a_{B}\), whose fluctuations are used to detect systematic differences. Likelihood functions based on distance moduli residuals are constructed, and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) techniques are applied to constrain the \(w_{0}w_{a}\)CDM model across various data combinations. The analysis specifically examines the impact on the \(w_{0}-w_{a}\) parameter contours when different subsets of data are included or excluded.","The analysis finds that replacing certain datasets—for instance, using DESI BAO instead of eBOSS BAO or DESY5 instead of PantheonPlus—results in an increase in the preference for dynamical dark energy, reaching roughly \(2.5 \sigma\) and \(2.9 \sigma\), respectively. However, when the problematic low-\(z\) SN sample is excluded or when corrective procedures (such as smoothing fluctuations in \(-5a_{B}\) or reducing the low-\(z\) magnitudes by \(\sim 0.043\)) are applied, the significance of the dynamical dark energy signal drops markedly to below \(2 \sigma\). Furthermore, the DESI BAO measurements, particularly in the LRG2 sample spanning \(0.6 < z < 0.8\), show deviations from the Planck-\(\Lambda\)CDM baseline that could hint at either dynamical dark energy or modified gravity. Despite these intriguing hints, the overall findings demonstrate that the apparent preference for dynamical dark energy is primarily driven by systematics in the low-\(z\) SN data.","The findings indicate that the strong signal for dynamical dark energy reported in the combined DESI and DESY5 analysis is most likely not a manifestation of new physics but rather the result of systematic calibration errors in the low-\(z\) supernova sample. The stable \(a_{B}\) distributions from DES-SN, which align closely with the Planck \(\Lambda\)CDM cosmology, contrast sharply with the irregular fluctuations observed in \( -5a_{B} \) for the low-\(z\) SNe. This inconsistency, exemplified by a \(\sim 0.043\) magnitude discrepancy that appears abruptly around \( z \sim 0.1 \), suggests that issues such as incorrect sample selection or calibration errors are biasing the cosmological inferences. As a consequence, the dynamical dark energy signal is significantly weakened when these systematics are addressed, emphasizing the need for careful cross-calibration among different SN samples.","The implications of this study are substantial for current cosmological analyses. By demonstrating that the preference for dynamical dark energy can be largely attributed to low-\(z\) SN systematics, the research reinforces the robustness of the standard \(\Lambda\)CDM model when such systematics are mitigated. Even though certain DESI BAO measurements exhibit deviations that could potentially suggest modified gravity or dynamical dark energy, the corrected signal falls short of providing compelling evidence against \(\Lambda\)CDM. This underscores the necessity for improved calibration procedures and more homogeneous data sets in future studies. In the broader context of resolving cosmological tensions—such as those related to the Hubble constant and \(S_{8}\)—this work stresses that careful treatment of observational systematics is essential before invoking new physics."
2502.03973,Axisymmetric stability of neutron stars as extreme rotators in massive scalar-tensor theory,Alan Tsz-Lok Lam et al.,"The study is motivated by the anticipated fifth observing run of the international gravitational wave network, expected in 2027, which aims to detect more binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, especially in the high-frequency band \(\gtrsim 10^{3}~\mathrm{Hz}\). These high-frequency post-merger waveforms are critical as they contain valuable information about the internal structure of hypermassive neutron stars (HMNS) and provide insights into the nature of gravity. In such mergers, hypermassive neutron stars are supported by differential rotation, thermal pressure, and magnetic forces, and their dynamics are strongly influenced by the nuclear equation of state (EOS) and the underlying gravitational theory. Scalar-tensor theories such as the Damour-Esposito-Farese (DEF) theory offer alternatives to general relativity (GR), and constraints on parameters like the scalar field mass \(m_{\phi}\) have been derived using observations from pulsar timing and gravitational waves. This context sets the stage for a detailed investigation of neutron stars in regimes where deviations from GR may become significant.","The central question of the work is whether scalarized neutron stars (NSs) with ultra-high angular momenta—potentially formed in BNS mergers—are dynamically stable. This investigation addresses the stability of differentially rotating NS configurations in DEF scalar-tensor gravity by extending the turning-point criterion, traditionally used for detecting secular instabilities in uniformly rotating NSs, to these more extreme rotators. By numerically evolving these configurations and determining the extremal points in the gravitational mass \(M_G\) as a function of the central energy density \(\epsilon_c\), the study aims to identify the onset of instabilities through the condition \(dJ/d\epsilon_c = dN/d\epsilon_c = 0\). The outcome of this research has the potential to reveal if such scalarized NS mergers produce ultra-highly rotating remnants that may be transient in nature, thus offering a new perspective on the mechanisms underpinning HMNS dynamics in alternative theories of gravity.","The analysis is conducted within the framework of DEF theory, where the starting point is the modified Jordan frame action given by  
\[
S= \frac{1}{16 \pi} \int d^{4} x \sqrt{-g}\left[\phi\, \mathcal{R}-\frac{\omega(\phi)}{\phi} \nabla_{a} \phi\, \nabla^{a} \phi-U(\phi)\right]-S_{\text{matter}},
\]  
with the coupling function \(\omega(\phi)= B\ln \phi\) and the potential \(U(\phi)=\frac{2m_{\phi}^{2}\varphi^{2}\phi^{2}}{B}\). Transforming to the Einstein frame via \(g_{ab}^{E}=\phi\, g_{ab}\) simplifies the potential to \(V=\frac{m_{\phi}^{2}\bar{\varphi}^{2}}{2B}\). Equilibrium models of scalarized NSs are constructed using a modified RNS code that employs the KEH scheme in the Einstein frame followed by transformation to the Jordan frame. In quasi-isotropic coordinates, the metric is formulated as  
\[
ds^{2} = -e^{\eta+\sigma}\, dt^{2} + e^{\eta-\sigma}\, r^{2}\sin^{2} \theta\left(d\phi^{2}-\varpi\, dt\right)^{2} + e^{2\tau}\left(dr^{2}+r^{2}d\theta^{2}\right).
\]  
The extrinsic curvature tensor and the matter 4-velocity, given by  
\[
u^{a}=\frac{w}{\sqrt{\alpha^{2}-\gamma_{\phi \phi}\varpi^{2}}}(1,0,0,\Omega),
\]  
play pivotal roles in capturing the dynamics, while a 4-parameter differential rotation law  
\[
\Omega=\Omega_{c}\frac{1+\left(\frac{F}{B^{2}\Omega_{c}}\right)^{p}}{1+\left(\frac{F}{A^{2}\Omega_{c}}\right)^{p+q}},
\]  
with \(F=u^{t}u_{\phi}\) and parameters controlling the shape via \(\lambda_{1}=\Omega_{\max}/\Omega_{c}\) and \(\lambda_{2}=\Omega_{e}/\Omega_{c}\), is employed. The total angular momentum is computed using  
\[
J=\int_{r<R_{\star}} \alpha\, \rho\, h\, F\, \sqrt{\gamma}\, d^{3}x.
\]  
To evolve these models, the researchers use the BSSN formulation in Cartesian coordinates augmented with the evolution of the scalar field \(\varphi\) and its momentum \(\Phi\). The modified evolution equations incorporate the scalar potential \(V(\phi)\) and the mass term \(m_{\phi}\) into the constraint propagation, while the moving puncture gauge addresses the lapse function \(\alpha\) and the shift vector \(\beta^{i}\). Numerical simulations are executed with 9 refinement levels, 6th-order finite differences, and the HLLC Riemann solver for hydrodynamics, with axisymmetry implemented via the cartoon method adapted from the SACRA-2D code. Sequences of models are studied by varying angular momentum \(J\) and central energy density \(\epsilon_c\), and both massless and massive scalar field cases are considered to assess the stability of the NS configurations.","For the massless scalar field case, turning points in the sequence were identified for angular momenta \(J=8\), \(12\), and \(20\), though such points were not reached for \(J=40\) due to numerical convergence issues, with models at \(J=40\) remaining stable. In the former cases, stability was tested over 10–20 different configurations per sequence, and marginally stable models were found just left of the maximum mass configuration, thereby validating the turning-point criterion. Stable models exhibited the damping of perturbations in maximum density and the central scalar field within a typical dynamical timescale, whereas unstable configurations underwent collapse into black holes with the scalar field decaying exponentially. The rotational profile of these systems, characterized by the rest-mass density, scalar field, and specific angular momentum \(j=h\, u_{\phi}\), remained largely unchanged over several dynamical timescales. In the massive scalar field scenario with \(m_{\phi}=0.01\), similar behavior was observed: turning points were apparent for sequences with \(J=8\) and \(J=12\), and instability onset occurred near these critical points. Meanwhile, sequences with \(J=20\) and \(J=30\) showed no turning points and thus maintained stability. Unstable models in the massive case also collapsed into black holes, though the decay of the scalar field occurred over a prolonged period as it approached an asymptotic value near \(\sim 10^{-3}\). Additionally, axisymmetric oscillation spectra for the \(J=8\) sequence revealed both the quasi-radial \(m=0\) fundamental mode and distinct \(\phi\)-modes, the latter decreasing towards the Yukawa cutoff frequency \(f_c=\omega_\phi/(2\pi)\) near the turning point, indicating that instability can be linked to the \(\phi\)-mode reaching this cutoff.","The results from the extensive 2D simulations provide a convincing validation of the turning-point criterion for differentially rotating, scalarized neutron stars within DEF scalar-tensor theory. The observation that instability sets in near extremal points in the constant-\(J\) sequences, consistent with the predictions of traditional turning-point methods in GR for rigidly rotating stars, firmly establishes the relevance of the criterion in these more exotic configurations. The study shows that, in the massless case, the emergence of instability is associated with the \(\phi\)-mode reaching the Yukawa cutoff frequency—a mechanism distinct from the fundamental mode instability observed in GR—while simultaneously reaffirming that stable models sustain their density distributions, scalar field profiles, and rotation laws over considerable dynamical timescales. These findings underscore the nuanced interplay between scalar field dynamics and rotational properties in shaping the stability characteristics of hypermassive neutron stars.","The insights drawn from this investigation are significant for the astrophysics community as they deepen the understanding of HMNS remnants formed in binary neutron star mergers within the context of scalar-tensor gravity. Specifically, the confirmation of the turning-point criterion in such settings and the identification of novel instability mechanisms, such as the role of the \(\phi\)-mode against the Yukawa cutoff, provide compelling evidence that ultra-highly rotating NS remnants may behave differently from their GR counterparts. Although the current axisymmetric simulations exclude non-axisymmetric instabilities like one-arm or bar-mode deformations—which would require full 3D simulations—the present work lays the groundwork for future studies. The implications extend to the broader endeavor of interpreting gravitational wave signals, where the dynamics and stability of HMNSs could serve as key probes for alternative theories of gravity and the internal physics of neutron stars."
2502.04080,AT 2018dyk: tidal disruption event or active galactic nucleus? Follow-up observations of an extreme coronal line emitter with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument,Steven Ahlen et al.,"Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when stars are shredded by the tidal forces of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), producing luminous transients with unique spectral and temporal properties. AT 2018dyk was originally identified as a candidate TDE but was later debated as possibly marking an active galactic nucleus (AGN) turn-on. Detailed follow-up observations, spanning optical and mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths, reveal phenomena such as rapid spectral evolution, the emergence of strong Fe coronal lines, and MIR outbursts. These observational signatures, along with host-galaxy characteristics and comparisons to other TDE-linked extreme coronal line emitters (TDE-ECLEs), suggest that AT 2018dyk is best interpreted as a TDE occurring in a gas-rich environment, setting it apart from typical AGN variability.","The primary motivation of this study is to resolve the ambiguity between a TDE and AGN-related activity in AT 2018dyk. Researchers sought to determine whether the observed extreme coronal line features, broad hydrogen and helium emissions, and MIR flares are consistent with the expectations from a tidal disruption event or indicative of AGN variability. By comparing AT 2018dyk to other well-studied transients such as CrL-TDEs, TDE-ECLEs, and AGN-ECLEs, the study aims to refine the classification of this event and enhance our understanding of the physical conditions, such as dust configuration and gas density near SMBHs, that govern the transient’s evolution.","A comprehensive set of spectroscopic and photometric observations across optical and MIR bands was employed. In the optical regime, data were drawn from DESI (2023), SDSS Legacy (2002), MaNGA (2017), and spectra obtained with Keck/LRIS and FLOYDS (2018). These were complemented by photometric monitoring from ATLAS (cyan/orange filters) and ZTF (gri filters), which provided pre-outburst, during, and post-outburst coverage. MIR observations from AllWISE and NEOWISE-R enabled the study of outburst characteristics and color-luminosity trends. Detailed analysis involved power-law fits to the MIR decline—for example, indices of \( -1.25 \pm 0.04 \) in \(W1\) and \( -1.02 \pm 0.03 \) in \(W2\)—as well as emission line fitting for features such as [O III] \(\lambda5007\) and various Fe coronal lines. Synthetic aperture techniques were used to rule out instrumental effects, while host-galaxy properties, including stellar mass, Sérsic index, specific star-formation rate, and central stellar velocity dispersion, were derived from MaNGA IFU data and other spectral diagnostics.","AT 2018dyk exhibited a pronounced optical evolution characterized by the rapid appearance and subsequent fading of broad H, He, and Fe coronal lines. Fe coronal lines emerged as early as 19 days after the optical peak and persisted for periods ranging from 35 up to 1819 days. Post-outburst spectra from Keck and LCOGT revealed typical TDE signatures, while the DESI spectrum taken more than five years later indicated a reversion to the pre-outburst state, apart from a significant strengthening of the [O III] \(\lambda5007\) emission. MIR observations demonstrated an outburst with a delayed peak of approximately 180 days relative to the optical maximum, with measured magnitude changes of \(\Delta W1 = 0.40 \pm 0.01\) mag, \(\Delta W2 = 0.79 \pm 0.01\) mag, and a corresponding color change \(\Delta(W1-W2) = 0.39 \pm 0.01\) mag. Power-law analyses of the MIR light curves yielded indices consistent with SMBH accretion models, and comparisons with CrL-TDEs and TDE-ECLEs highlighted similar variability patterns, albeit with shorter duration and smaller amplitude. Emission line fitting further quantified the spectral evolution; for instance, the Keck spectrum (+23 days) revealed Fe coronal line equivalent widths ranging from \(-2.5 \pm 0.8\) Å to \(-1.0 \pm 0.3\) Å and FWHM velocities between 640 and 1370 km s\(^{-1}\). Host galaxy analysis showed that SDSS J1533+4432, with a stellar mass of \(11.02 \pm 0.02 \log_{10}(M_{\odot})\) and a Sérsic index of \(2.20 \pm 0.01\), exhibits properties typical of TDE hosts, including a stellar surface mass density of \(8.46 \pm 0.02 \log_{10}(\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{kpc}^{-2})\) and a specific star-formation rate of \(-10.97 \pm 0.13 \log_{10}(\mathrm{yr}^{-1})\). Additionally, emission line ratios such as \(\log_{10}([N II]/H\alpha) = 2.4 \pm 0.2\) and \(\log_{10}([O III]/H\beta) = -0.6 \pm 0.1\) were derived, and the SMBH mass was estimated through both spectral indicators and virial relationships, with a final mass on the order of \(7.27 \times 10^{6}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\).","The combined optical and MIR observations reinforce the interpretation of AT 2018dyk as a tidal disruption event occurring in a gas-rich environment rather than a manifestation of AGN variability. The early emergence and temporal evolution of Fe coronal lines, together with the delayed and modest MIR outbursts, suggest rapid X-ray reprocessing in the vicinity of the SMBH. The delayed enhancement in [O III] emission, with consistent FWHM velocities and redshifted offsets, implies a layered gas structure reacting to the transient ionizing flux, rather than to a change in the underlying accretion regime. In addition, the host galaxy's properties—including its star-forming regions, LINER-like emission from evolved stellar populations as indicated by WHAN diagnostics, and an older stellar nucleus confirmed by D4000 mapping—further substantiate the TDE scenario. The similarity of the derived MIR power-law indices with those observed in other TDE-related events lends additional support to a reprocessing model intrinsic to transient SMBH accretion phenomena.","The findings from AT 2018dyk have significant implications for our understanding of tidal disruption events in gas-rich environments. The detailed multi-wavelength analysis underscores the importance of MIR diagnostics for probing the dust geometry and reprocessing mechanisms that follow a TDE, while the spectral evolution observed in optical emission lines provides a direct link between transient accretion phenomena and the dynamical state of the circumnuclear medium. These results not only aid in distinguishing TDEs from AGN variability but also contribute to refining models of SMBH-driven feedback and the structure of the nuclear environment. Furthermore, the study highlights the necessity of long-term, multi-epoch observations to capture the full evolution of such transients, thereby informing future surveys and theoretical developments in the field of transient astrophysics."
2502.04041,GrayHawk: A public code for calculating the Gray Body Factors of massless fields around spherically symmetric Black Holes,Marco Calzá et al.,"Black holes have long been recognized as unique laboratories for understanding the interplay between gravity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics. Over the years, groundbreaking observations such as gravitational-wave signals from binary mergers and the direct imaging of supermassive black holes have deepened our insight into these enigmatic objects. A fundamental aspect of black hole physics is Hawking radiation—the quasi-thermal emission predicted by Stephen Hawking—which has spurred extensive research into black hole thermodynamics and the behavior of perturbations in curved spacetimes. In this context, the analysis of gray-body factors, which modify the pure thermal radiation emitted near the horizon as it propagates to infinity, has proven essential for producing precise emission spectra and exploring phenomena ranging from primordial black holes as dark matter candidates to quantum gravitational effects.","While semi-analytical methods have historically provided valuable insights into the computation of gray-body factors (GBFs) for various black hole configurations, their inherent approximations often limit precision. The need for accurate numerical tools becomes especially evident when exploring modified gravity scenarios or black hole metrics inspired by quantum gravity, such as those exhibiting nonsingular behavior or black hole-to-white hole transitions. Additionally, the opportunity to study the emission spectra of fields with diverse spins—and to probe the subtle interplay of different potential barriers using tailored numerical techniques—motivated the creation of a versatile and precise computational code that could serve as a robust foundation for future studies in black hole physics.","The development of GrayHawk is underpinned by detailed theoretical formalism that considers spherically symmetric, static, and asymptotically flat metrics of the form  
\[
ds^{2} = -G(r)dt^{2} + \frac{dr^{2}}{F(r)} + H(r)d\Omega^{2},
\]  
where \(d\Omega^{2}\) represents the solid-angle element. This general framework encompasses classical examples such as the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordström metrics as well as regular and modified black hole spacetimes like those proposed by Hayward, Bardeen, Simpson-Visser, Peltola-Kunstatter, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli. By employing the Newman-Penrose formalism and expressing massless field perturbations in terms of NP-scalars \(\Upsilon_{s}\), the code reduces the problem to solving a master radial equation. Introducing the tortoise coordinate via  
\[
\frac{dr^{*}}{dr} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{F(r)G(r)}},
\]  
the radial equation assumes a Schrödinger-like form where the effective potential \(V_{s}(r)\) vanishes at both the horizon and at infinity. With boundary conditions set to impose purely ingoing waves at the horizon, the asymptotic behavior is characterized by expressions such as  
\[
Z_{s}(r^{*}\rightarrow -\infty) = \mathfrak{a}e^{i\omega r^{*}} + \mathfrak{b}e^{-i\omega r^{*}},
\]  
with the transmission coefficient defined as \(T=1/|b|^{2}\) and serving as the gray-body factor \(\Gamma_{s}^{l}(\omega)\). GrayHawk is implemented as a publicly available Mathematica code organized into two main files—GrayHawk.nb for computing GBFs and CalibratorGH.nb for calibration. Key components of the numerical methodology include the inversion of tortoise coordinates to generate the mapping \(r(r^{*})\), the determination of the horizon radius by finding the largest root of \(F(r)\), and careful sampling of the domain in both near-horizon and far-field regimes. The code also incorporates a procedure to fit the numerical solution in the far-away region to restore the asymptotic form of the wave function, ensuring that the GBFs are computed with high precision even for complex metrics or modified black hole scenarios.","GrayHawk produces detailed emission spectra by solving the radial equation for a predefined energy table, typically spanning energies from 0 to 1 (in units where \(M=1\)). In its default configuration—applying the Schwarzschild metric—the code uses a robust sampling strategy with 998 logarithmically spaced points near the horizon and 4998 equidistant points in the far-field region, ensuring continuity between these regimes. The computed GBFs, determined via the relation \(\Gamma = 1/|b|^{2}\), agree remarkably well with published results across multiple black hole metrics. Validation against spectra for Hayward, Bardeen, Simpson-Visser, Peltola-Kunstatter, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli black holes demonstrates that the residuals at spectral peaks remain below 1%, confirming the accuracy of GrayHawk. While computational times are generally in the 7–10 second range for standard configurations, they increase as expected for more complex geometries.","The high level of agreement between GrayHawk’s computed spectra and established results underscores the reliability of the numerical methods employed. The ability to reduce a complicated system of perturbation equations to a single master equation using the Newman-Penrose formalism—and to subsequently integrate this equation with careful attention to boundary conditions—affirms the robustness of the chosen approach. Moreover, the nuanced treatment of the tortoise coordinate transformation and the calibration of sampling intervals across different energy scales provide a clear rationale for the observed precision. These findings firmly establish GrayHawk not only as a tool for obtaining accurate gray-body factors but also as a means to explore the subtle modifications to black hole emission properties that arise in various theoretical models, including those motivated by quantum gravity.","The introduction of GrayHawk has significant implications for the study of black hole physics. By addressing the limitations of previous semi-analytical methods, the code offers researchers a precise numerical framework capable of exploring Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation with unprecedented accuracy. Its adaptability to a variety of metrics—including those emerging from modifications of general relativity and Loop Quantum Gravity-inspired models—opens new avenues for understanding the quantum aspects of black holes. Furthermore, as studies of primordial black holes and their potential role as dark matter candidates continue to evolve, tools like GrayHawk provide critical insights into emission spectra that could bridge theoretical predictions with observational data. The prospects for future extensions, such as the inclusion of additional fields and further refined metrics, promise to deepen our grasp of fundamental physics and the quantum properties of spacetime."
2502.03830,Unveiling the emission properties of three long-period pulsars using FAST,H. M. Tedila et al.,"Pulsars are highly magnetized neutron stars known for their stable radio emissions, yet they manifest a range of intriguing variability phenomena such as nulls, mode changes, bright pulses, and microstructures. These behaviors—where nulls represent periods of diminished or absent emission, bright pulses indicate intense flares, and microstructures unfold the underlying emission dynamics—are thought to arise from instabilities in the magnetosphere or disruptions in plasma supply. The FAST telescope, with its remarkable sensitivity and a 300-meter aperture, has significantly advanced pulsar studies by not only discovering over 180 new pulsars but also providing detailed insights into the emission characteristics of long-period pulsars, including those with notable magnetic fields and distinctive spin-down energy loss rates.","The primary motivation of the study is to explore and understand the complex emission behaviors observed in long-period pulsars, particularly those exhibiting quasi-periodic nulls, dwarf pulses, and intricate microstructures. By focusing on pulsars such as PSR J1945+1211, PSR J2323+1214, and PSR J1900-0134, the research aims to elucidate the diverse magnetospheric processes at work. These investigations are crucial as they challenge traditional pulsar theories, especially near the pulsar death line, and provide a pathway to understanding the mechanisms governing plasma generation, subpulse modulation, and emission geometry.","The observations were carried out using the FAST telescope during the CRAFTS Survey, with data acquired through a 19-beam receiver operating in the frequency range of 1.05–1.45 GHz and processed by a ROACH2 system. The data were recorded with a time resolution of \(49.152\, \mu\mathrm{s}\) and a frequency resolution of \(0.488\, \mathrm{MHz}\), then processed offline using DSPSR and PSRCHIVE software. Rigorous RFI excision was performed, and single-pulse sequences were averaged, baseline-subtracted, and organized into pulse stacks. Flux calibration was executed using the radiometer equation, yielding an average flux density of \(S_{\text{av}} \approx 3.5\, \mathrm{mJy}\). Specific emission features were isolated using selection criteria; for example, dwarf pulses in PSR J2323+1214 were identified by first selecting burst pulses with energy \(>5\, \eta_{\text{on}}\) and subsequently filtering for pulses with peak flux densities less than \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the average profile and widths narrower than \(1.87^\circ\). Analysis techniques such as FFT, LRFS, and 2DFS were employed to determine periodicities and modulation indices, revealing quasi-periodic null-burst transitions and microstructure properties.","FAST observations revealed that PSR J1945+1211, PSR J2323+1214, and PSR J1900-0134 demonstrate diverse single-pulse behaviors. PSR J1945+1211 exhibits the widest pulse profile with an angle of \(29.53^\circ\) (and even wider active pulses at \(31.3^\circ\)), while PSR J2323+1214 has a notably narrow profile of \(7.73^\circ\) and also shows asymmetries; for instance, its leading component has a null fraction of \(61.34\% \pm 1.82\%\) compared to \(50.27\% \pm 1.73\%\) in the trailing component. Null fractions vary among the pulsars, with PSR J1945+1211 at \(52.46\% \pm 2.89\%\), PSR J2323+1214 at \(48.48\% \pm 2.51\%\), and PSR J1900-0134 at \(27.51\% \pm 1.37\%\). FFT analysis unraveled quasi-periodic transitions: PSR J1945+1211 displays a periodicity of \(15.38 \pm 0.90\) pulsar periods, while PSR J2323+1214 exhibits a periodicity of \(22.22 \pm 2.4\) periods, although PSR J1900-0134 does not reveal a clear periodicity. The study also detected five dwarf pulses in PSR J2323+1214, representing \(0.011\%\) of all observations and confined to the trailing component, suggesting a sporadic and unstable emission mechanism. Bright pulses, defined as pulses with peak intensities greater than \(10\times\) the average, were observed across the pulsars with varying occurrence rates—PSR J1900-0134 (1.3% of 976 pulses), PSR J1945+1211 (2.92% of 377 pulses), and an isolated instance in PSR J2323+1214. Furthermore, the first microstructure studies conducted with FAST uncovered 95 microstructure pulses in PSR J1900-0134, categorized into six types with spiky pulses being predominant (\(29.37\%\)). Their periodicities range from \(0.098\) ms to \(3.792\) ms, with a median of \(2.13\) ms, and the peak flux densities follow a log-normal distribution centered at \(8.03\, \mathrm{mJy}\).","The complex and varied emission properties observed in these long-period pulsars provide new insights into pulsar magnetospheric dynamics. The high null fractions, especially in PSR J1945+1211 and PSR J2323+1214, suggest that decreased pair production efficiency near the pulsar death line may trigger plasma instabilities leading to nulling. The differences in pulse profile widths and the asymmetry between leading and trailing components indicate potential variations in the emission beam geometry or localized magnetospheric conditions. Quasi-periodic null and burst transitions imply that there may be intrinsic, structured changes within the pulsar magnetospheres, such as rotating subbeam carousels or intermittent plasma generation disruptions. The presence of dwarf pulses, bright pulses, and diverse microstructure types further emphasizes the non-uniform and dynamic nature of pulsar emission, potentially reflecting localized magnetospheric activities that evolve over distinct timescales.","These findings challenge traditional pulsar emission theories by demonstrating that long-period pulsars, particularly those operating near the theoretical death line, can sustain complex and varied emission phenomena. The diversity in null fractions, pulse profile widths, and microstructure patterns underscores the need for high-sensitivity observations to fully unravel the underlying astrophysical processes. As pulsar emission mechanisms are likely influenced by age, rotation, and magnetospheric conditions, this study provides crucial evidence that can refine existing models and prompt further theoretical and observational work. The intricate details captured by FAST not only enhance our understanding of pulsar magnetospheres but also suggest that even pulsars with slower rotations can exhibit rich, dynamic behaviors that are key to probing fundamental plasma processes in extreme environments."
2502.04039,A Cloud-native Agile approach to cyber platform prototyping and integration for astronomy: the ENGAGE SKA case,Domingos Barbosa et al.,"The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) is rapidly advancing the construction of two radio interferometers located in Australia (SKA-Low) and South Africa (SKA1-Mid), with the first science operations expected by 2026 and First Light already achieved in January 2024. The project features an impressive scale that includes 130,000 low-frequency antennas covering a range from 50 MHz to 350 MHz and 200 mid-frequency antennas spanning 350 MHz to 15.5 GHz. These systems produce raw data rates exceeding \(10\,\mathrm{Tb/s}\) and require computing power of up to \(100\,\mathrm{Pflop/s}\) while demanding a 99.9% availability standard. Integral to managing this highly complex ecosystem, SKAO employs agile methodologies and state-of-the-art software practices that mirror large-scale projects such as those at ALMA, Vera Rubin Observatory, LOFAR, and GMRT. These experiences have shaped an innovative, cloud-native development approach that emphasizes deployability, modifiability, and testability while iteratively integrating components of the software ecosystem.","The increasing complexity and scale of the SKA project, particularly its enormous data volumes and stringent operational requirements, necessitated a new paradigm for software development and integration. The need to implement a software architecture that is both scalable and sustainable—capable of managing raw data exceeding \(10\,\mathrm{Tb/s}\) and ensuring reliable operations with 99.9% availability—drove the adoption of agile methodologies, cloud computing, DevOps principles, and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Furthermore, challenges in resource management, integration across heterogeneous subsystems, and the imperative to reduce operational cost and carbon emissions inspired the development of innovative prototyping and integration tools like the SKA Minimal Viable Product Integration (SKAMPI) and the cloud-based EngageSKA cluster.","A cloud-native, agile approach underpins the project’s development and integration strategy, using iterative software development methods that involve breaking complex functionalities into microservices. Agile practices are scaled enterprise-wide through frameworks such as SAFe®, supporting a six-phase Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that includes concept, inception, iteration, release, maintenance, and retirement. The integration environment leverages tools like GitLab for CI/CD orchestration, containerization with Kubernetes and Helm charts, and automated deployment strategies utilizing OpenStack Kayobe for lightweight, multi-tenancy. The SKAMPI toolset provided a staging environment for continuous integration, automating system-wide assembly that integrated key components such as the Telescope Manager (TM), Central Signal Processor (CSP), and Science Data Processor (SDP). Additionally, the EngageSKA cluster, hosted at the Institute of Telecommunications in Aveiro, Portugal, provided the necessary scalable, cloud-based infrastructure. This architecture supported an OpenStack deployment alongside a Kubernetes cluster (syscore) for comprehensive testing, integration, and optimization of the SKA software components. Complementary tools like Tango Controls for distributed middleware and Webjive-based Taranta for device monitoring facilitate the orchestration and management of heterogeneous devices within the system.","The use of cloud-native and agile methodologies resulted in a robust and scalable integration framework, providing a portable, virtualized testing environment that decoupled developers from hardware constraints while ensuring end-to-end operational functionality. SKAMPI, despite its early challenges such as brittleness and lack of resource ownership, paved the way for improved integration practices by consolidating software artifacts under an automated CI/CD framework. The lessons learned from SKAMPI’s limitations led to the development of a more reliable system for Array Integration and Verification (AIV), with refined workflows in separate repositories for SKA Mid and Low systems. The EngageSKA cluster further demonstrated its value by offering scalable resources—including 16 rack servers with compute, controller, storage, and GPU nodes—that supported data challenges, optimized reduction pipelines, and facilitated remote collaboration via secure access methods.","The transition to a cloud-native, agile framework in the SKA project highlights the significance of modern software development and integration techniques in managing large-scale, data-intensive astronomical observatories. By integrating container orchestration, automated deployment, and continuous feedback loops within CI/CD pipelines, the project drastically reduced both resource consumption and operational complexities. The use of standardized APIs, containerization practices, and both centralized configuration and automated deployment (for example, employing Ansible and libguestfs for resource migration improvements) helped overcome significant challenges such as unexpected behavior in complex array release trains and resource management issues. These improvements underlie a more resilient, adaptable, and efficient development ecosystem, capable of meeting the rigorous demands of SKA operations.","The successful application of a cloud-native agile approach not only enhances the SKA’s operational efficiency and scalability but also contributes to broader trends in green ICT by reducing overall carbon emissions and operational costs. The integration of modular performance monitoring tools such as Prometheus, Thanos, and Grafana further reinforces this sustainable, efficient design. Ultimately, the ENGAGE SKA platform and the lessons derived from its evolution support SKAO’s ongoing transition to a Lean Enterprise while fostering a collaborative, continuously improving environment. This establishes a benchmark for future astronomical projects that require a high degree of scalability, flexibility, and innovation in their technological architectures."
2502.03764,Candidate RR Lyrae Associated with the Ultrafaint Dwarf Galaxy Aquarius III,Chow-Choong Ngeow et al.,"RR Lyrae stars serve as essential tracers for understanding the distances, metallicities, and ages of ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (UFDs), while also providing insights into the characteristics of their old stellar populations. Aquarius III, a recently discovered UFD, exhibits similarities to Virgo III in terms of stellar mass, half-light radius \(r_h\), and absolute \(V\)-band magnitude \(M_V\), and empirical studies suggest that such galaxies with \(M_V \gtrsim -5.0\) mag typically host approximately \(1 \pm 1\) RR Lyrae. These properties set the stage for investigations aimed at clarifying the stellar content and evolutionary history of these faint systems.","The primary impetus behind this work is to locate and characterize RR Lyrae stars associated with Aquarius III. By doing so, the study seeks to refine our knowledge of the intrinsic properties of UFDs, such as their distance, metallicity, and age, through the well-established period-luminosity and period-Wesenheit-metallicity relations. Moreover, exploring the occurrence of RR Lyrae stars in such low-luminosity galaxies, as suggested by synthetic color-magnitude diagram (CMD) simulations, can enhance our understanding of the formation and evolution of ancient stellar systems in the Galactic halo.","A comprehensive observational campaign was undertaken using time-series photometry from the Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) between 06 November and 07 December 2024. A total of 64 \(r\)-band images were acquired with 600-second exposures under a median seeing of \(1.26^{\prime \prime}\) and a depth of approximately \(r \sim 22.0\) mag, utilizing the Princeton Instruments SOPHIA 2048B CCD camera to obtain a field-of-view of \(13.1^{\prime} \times 13.1^{\prime}\). The detected sources were cross-matched with the SDSS DR16 catalog before calibrating magnitudes to the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) AB system. In addition to LOT observations, archival data from the PS1 \(3 \pi\) RR Lyrae Catalog, Gaia DR3, and ZTF DR22 were employed to search within a radius of up to \(16 r_h\) from Aquarius III. Light curves in the \(gri\) bands were analyzed, and the pulsation period was refined (e.g., \(P = 0.648708\) days) by utilizing template light curve fitting methods. Synthetic CMDs were also generated using the BaSTI tool with \(\alpha\)-enhanced models, adopting a helium abundance \(Y = 0.247\), a normalized star formation rate of 1, an age of 13 Gyr, a metallicity of \(-2.4\) dex, and the Kroupa initial mass function over 100 realizations for a total stellar mass of \(\sim 2000\, M_{\odot}\).","The analysis revealed a candidate RR Lyrae star identified from archival catalogs, designated Aquarius III-V1, which is located approximately \(15.6\, r_h\) from the galaxy’s center. Its proper motion \((\mu_{\alpha *}, \mu_{\delta}) = (0.923 \pm 0.637, -0.549 \pm 0.565)\) mas yr\(^{-1}\), extinction-corrected mean \(r\)-band magnitude of \(20.05\) mag, and refined pulsation period of \(0.648708\) days all align with the properties expected for Aquarius III, as confirmed by the corresponding photometric metallicity of \(-2.38 \pm 0.39\) dex, which is consistent with the spectroscopic value of \(-2.61 \pm 0.21\) dex. In contrast, another candidate found at \(r \sim 21.5\) mag near \(\sim 4 r_h\) from the center was determined to be a background RR Lyrae residing at a distance of approximately \(163.1 \pm 14.2\) kpc based on its period-luminosity-metallicity relation in the \(r\)-band. Synthetic CMD simulations further supported the non-negligible statistical probability that UFDs like Aquarius III and Virgo III host at least one RR Lyrae star, with 27 out of 100 generated CMDs containing one RR Lyrae and 7 containing two.","The convergence of photometric, proper motion, and period analyses indicates that Aquarius III-V1 is indeed associated with Aquarius III, despite being located well outside the central region. The alignment of its distance, derived as \(87.9 \pm 5.7\) kpc using period-Wesenheit-metallicity relations, with Aquarius III’s estimated distance of \(85 \pm 4\) kpc, supports its membership, while the detailed light curve fitting reinforces its classification as an ab-type RR Lyrae. Meanwhile, the identification of a background RR Lyrae candidate underscores the complexity of distinguishing between halo contaminants and bona fide galaxy members, an issue that is addressed by meticulous multi-catalog comparisons and template fits.","These findings underscore the efficacy of RR Lyrae stars as probes of the stellar populations in UFDs, particularly in systems with very low luminosities. The confirmation of Aquarius III-V1 as the first RR Lyrae associated with Aquarius III not only enhances our ability to calibrate distance scales and constrain the metallicity and structural properties of UFDs but also motivates further searches in similarly faint galaxies. This study encourages the use of extensive time-series photometry combined with synthetic CMD modeling to disentangle member stars from background contaminants, thereby improving our overall understanding of dwarf galaxy evolution and the assembly of the Galactic halo."

S_{BG} = -k_{B} \sum_{i} P_{i} \ln P_{i},
\]  
often fall short in describing systems that exhibit long-range interactions and non-additive behavior. This shortfall has motivated the adoption of nonextensive statistical mechanics, specifically through Tsallis entropy, to better characterize the entropic nuances in astrophysical sources like Quasar 3C 273.","The study is driven by the need to explore and quantify the nonextensive behavior in quasar light curves that conventional Gaussian statistics are unable to adequately describe. With observed deviations marked by \(q\) entropic indices predominantly greater than 1, there emerges a compelling motivation to employ the Tsallis framework in modeling the heavy-tailed flux distributions observed in 3C 273. The primary aim is to bridge the gap between traditional statistical approaches and the inherent complexities of AGN variability, specifically by analyzing 39 light curves spanning from radio to X-rays, thus unravelling the intricate entropy-energy relationship and pinpointing significant entropy jumps in key energy bands.","The investigation utilizes 39 light curves of Quasar 3C 273 collected from 1963 to 2005 in the ISDC database, encompassing a wide range of wavelengths: radio (5–37 GHz), millimeter/submillimeter (0.8–3.3 mm), infrared (1.25–3.6 \(\mu\)m), optical (3439–7000 Å), ultraviolet (1300–3000 Å), and X-ray (5–200 keV). To ensure data quality, a flagging system was implemented so that only reliable light curves, marked with flags 0 or +1, were incorporated in the analysis. The core method involves fitting the observed flux distributions with the \(q\)-Gaussian function defined as  
\[
P_{q}(y) = A_{q}\left[1+(q-1)\left(\frac{y}{\sigma_{q}}\right)^{2}\right]^{\frac{1}{1-q}},
\]  
where \(y = (x - \langle x \rangle)/\sigma\) normalizes the flux data, and parameters such as \(A_{q}\) and \(\sigma_{q}\) capture the distribution’s shape. Alongside, Tsallis entropy is employed, formulated as  
\[
S_{q} = k_{B} \frac{1-\sum_{i} P_{i}^{q}}{q-1},
\]  
to model the energetics of the system. The study also incorporates an exponential model,  
\[
S_{q}=A+B \exp(-E/E_{0}),
\]  
to describe the relationship between entropy and energy across different spectral regimes, with parameters \(A\), \(B\), and \(E_{0}\) determined for distinct energy ranges.","The analysis confirms that all examined light curves adhere to Tsallis distributions with \(q>1\), signifying the presence of long-tailed flux distributions where standard Gaussian fitting fails, especially beyond the \(1\sigma\) threshold. For example, the 8 GHz radio light curve is best described by a \(q\)-Gaussian fit with \(q=1.60\) and a correlation coefficient \(R^{2}=0.997\). Notably, the study identifies two distinct entropy jumps along the energy spectrum. The first jump occurs in the infrared, with a pronounced peak at 0.34 eV that corresponds closely with synchrotron flares and thermal radiation from hot dust. The second jump is observed in the X-ray band; however, its statistical significance is diminished due to limitations in data quality. Fitting the entropy-energy relationship reveals differing parameter sets: in the radio to submillimeter range, \(A=2.10 \pm 0.92\), \(B=0.01 \pm 0.023\), and \(E_{0}=0.65 \pm 0.46\) eV, while in the IR to X-ray range, the parameters are \(A=1.91 \pm 2.11\), \(B=9.04 \pm 2.43\), and \(E_{0}=0.64 \pm 0.18\) eV, with corresponding correlation coefficients of 0.51 and 0.75 respectively.","The outcomes suggest that the Tsallis framework is an effective tool in capturing the intricate variability of Quasar 3C 273. The predominance of \(q>1\) values across most spectral bands strongly implies that the flux distributions are characterized by significant deviations from Gaussianity, driven by processes such as synchrotron flares. The distinct IR peak at 0.34 eV is interpreted as a physical signature of the synergy between synchrotron flares and the thermal emission from hot dust. Conversely, although an X-ray entropy jump is detected, its uncertain nature—likely a consequence of poorer data quality—indicates that further high-resolution observations are necessary to clarify the underlying high-energy processes, potentially related to Comptonization phenomena. The observed parallel between the growth of the entropic index \(q\) and the trends in fractional variability reinforces the connection between statistical measures and the physical drivers of flux variability.","These findings enhance our understanding of AGN physics by demonstrating the applicability and potential of nonextensive statistical mechanics in interpreting the complex behavior of quasar light curves. The study illustrates that while the Tsallis \(q\)-Gaussian approach can effectively model most of the observed spectral regimes, nuances such as the Gaussian-like behavior in the IR band indicate that the physical mechanisms driving energy distribution are multifaceted. The implication is clear: to fully unravel the dynamics of sources like Quasar 3C 273, it is imperative to further refine statistical models and secure higher-quality data, especially in the X-ray domain. This work paves the way for future explorations into the interplay between synchrotron processes, thermal radiation, and high-energy phenomena in AGNs, ultimately contributing to a deeper comprehension of the nonextensive nature underpinning astrophysical variability."
2502.03794,The \(\mathbf{G e V}\),Yuliang Xin et al.,"Supernova remnants (SNRs) are recognized as key sites for Galactic cosmic ray acceleration, and pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) – dynamic structures powered by pulsars – further enrich our understanding of high-energy astrophysics. CTB 87 is an intriguing composite SNR, associated with the TeV source VER J2016+371, that exhibits a filled-center morphology dominated by synchrotron emission from a PWN. Observations across the electromagnetic spectrum reveal significant complexity: radio data show a kidney-shaped structure with steepening of the spectrum above 11 GHz, while X-ray studies identify a diffuse nebula surrounding what was initially considered a candidate pulsar (CXOU J2016+3711) and later confirmed as PSR J2016+3711 by FAST. The system’s \(\gamma\)-ray emission, first detected by VERITAS and later explored by Fermi-LAT, points to interactions with molecular clouds (MCs) and possibly involves contributions from both hadronic and leptonic processes.",The primary motivation for this study is to dissect the complex emission mechanisms within CTB 87 by leveraging long-term \(\gamma\)-ray observations. The composite nature of CTB 87—with its mixture of PWN features and SNR shock interactions with MCs—necessitates a detailed analysis to distinguish between hadronic and leptonic origins of the observed radiation. Determining whether the soft-spectrum \(\gamma\)-ray component emerges from SNR-MC interactions or if the hard-spectrum emission is the GeV counterpart of VER J2016+371’s PWN is essential for advancing our understanding of particle acceleration and energy dissipation processes in such systems.,"Over 16 years of Fermi-LAT Pass 8 data, spanning from August 4, 2008, to September 4, 2024, were analyzed in the energy range from 1 GeV to 1 TeV. A \(20^{\circ} \times 20^{\circ}\) region of interest, centered on CTB 87 (R.A. \(=304.057^{\circ}\), decl. \(=37.213^{\circ}\)), was selected, while events with zenith angles greater than \(90^{\circ}\) were excluded to minimize Earth Limb contamination. The analysis employed the Fermi Science Tools with IRF ""P8R3_SOURCE_V3"" and involved binned likelihood analysis. Background models comprised the Galactic diffuse model \( \text{gll\_iem\_v07.fits} \) and the isotropic model \( \text{iso\_P8R3\_SOURCE\_V3\_v1.txt} \), and known sources from the 4FGL-DR4 catalog within the ROI were incorporated into the source model. In addition, spatial analysis using a \(4^{\circ} \times 4^{\circ}\) Test Statistic (TS) map in the 1 GeV–1 TeV range allowed for the identification of new \(\gamma\)-ray sources, followed by power-law spectral fitting (with indices and normalizations determined through likelihood analysis) and further segmentation into spectral energy bins. The spectral analysis included modeling separate components (PsA and PsB) with power laws – supplemented by log-parabola tests where applicable – and used detailed fittings to compare with available TeV observations. Moreover, extension significance tests employing 2D Gaussian models were performed as part of the comprehensive analysis.","The Fermi-LAT analysis resolved two distinct GeV \(\gamma\)-ray sources near CTB 87. One component, labeled PsA, exhibits a soft spectrum with a power-law index of approximately \(2.9\) and a Test Statistic (TS) value of 262.83 in the lower energy range (1–30 GeV), suggesting a likely origin from SNR-MC interactions. In contrast, the second component, PsB, with a much harder spectrum (index around \(1.7\)) and manifest predominantly in higher energies (30 GeV–1 TeV), aligns spatially and spectrally with VER J2016+371, potentially representing its GeV counterpart. Detailed spatial refittings yielded precise coordinates for the candidate source 4FGL J2016.2+3712, and the spectra of these sources were characterized by integral photon fluxes of approximately \((2.69 \pm 0.32) \times 10^{-9}\) and \((2.21 \pm 1.46) \times 10^{-10}\) photon \(\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\) for PsA and PsB, respectively. Global power-law fits were found to be consistent with VERITAS TeV data, supporting the validity of the two-source model.","The soft GeV component, PsA, is interpreted as typical of SNR-MC interaction systems, akin to known cases such as IC 443 and W44. Its spectrum is explained with a proton power-law model featuring an exponential cutoff of the form 
\[
\frac{dN}{dE_p} \propto E_p^{-\alpha_p}\exp\left(-\frac{E_p}{E_{p,\text{cut}}}\right),
\]
assuming an average gas density of \(n_{\text{gas}} \sim 40\, \text{cm}^{-3}\), a proton spectral index \(\alpha_p \sim 2.9\), and a total proton energy above 1 GeV of \(W_p \sim 5.0 \times 10^{49}\) erg. The absence of detectable SNR shock features suggests that the shock may have dissipated over time. For the hard component, PsB, the spectral evidence supports a PWN scenario powered by PSR J2016+3711, which has a spin-down luminosity \(\dot{E} = 2.2 \times 10^{37}\, \text{erg s}^{-1}\) and a characteristic age \(\tau_c = 11.1\, \text{kyr}\). The TeV luminosity of the associated PWN, estimated as \(L_{1-10\, \text{TeV}} \approx 2.8 \times 10^{33}\, \text{erg s}^{-1}\) with an efficiency of roughly \(0.01\%\), follows expectations for typical \(\gamma\)-ray PWNe. Its multi-wavelength data are well modeled by a one-zone leptonic scenario featuring a broken power-law electron distribution with an exponential cutoff:
\[
\frac{dN_e}{dE} \propto \frac{(E/E_{\text{br}})^{-\gamma_1}}{1 + (E/E_{\text{br}})^{\gamma_2 - \gamma_1}}\exp\left(-\frac{E}{E_{e,\text{cut}}}\right),
\]
where the break energy \(E_{\text{br}} \sim 9\, \text{GeV}\) is consistent with the observed high-frequency radio steepening; the spectral indices were found to be \(\gamma_1 \sim 1.5\) and \(\gamma_2 \sim 2.8\), with a cutoff energy \(E_{e,\text{cut}} > 400\, \text{TeV}\) and a magnetic field of approximately \(7\, \mu\text{G}\). The synchrotron cooling timescale exceeding the pulsar’s age implies that the observed spectral break is intrinsic to the injection mechanism.","The findings underscore the complexity of CTB 87 as a composite SNR, where both hadronic and leptonic processes contribute to the observed \(\gamma\)-ray emission. Future observations with next-generation facilities such as LHAASO and CTA, along with deeper radio and X-ray studies, will be crucial in further disentangling these processes and refining our understanding of particle acceleration in such systems. These results not only help clarify the mechanisms behind \(\gamma\)-ray production in environments where SNR shocks interact with molecular clouds but also enhance our comprehension of PWN dynamics and evolution, which in turn has broader implications for studies of cosmic ray acceleration in our Galaxy."
2502.03947,An Elaborate Search for Coherent Pulsations from Intermittent-AMXPs,Mustafa Turan Sağlam et al.,"This study focuses on three Intermittent-Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars (Intermittent-AMXPs): HETE J1900.1-2455, SAX J1748.9-2021, and Aql X-1, which are part of the low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) family. These systems occasionally display millisecond pulsations during outbursts, serving as unique laboratories for understanding the pulse phenomena in environments where persistent pulsations are often absent. The investigation is based on 16 years of RXTE/PCA observations, providing extensive temporal data within the \(3.0-13.0 \, \mathrm{keV}\) energy range. In this context, prior challenges such as detecting coherent pulsations in most LMXBs, potentially due to factors like weak magnetic fields, gravitational lensing, and Compton scattering, set the stage for a detailed analysis of intermittent pulse behavior.","The study is motivated by the long-standing puzzle of sporadic X-ray pulsations in a subset of LMXBs, where the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. With intermittent-AMXPs showing only brief episodes of pulsations—such as Aql X-1’s 550.25 Hz pulse detected for just 150 seconds during cyclic outbursts, or HETE J1900.1-2455’s sporadic pulses following its initial outburst—the research aims to explore these erratic behaviors and reveal insights into the intricacies of pulse dynamics and orbital parameters. By addressing these peculiar pulse phenomena, the work seeks to enhance our understanding of how accretion processes, magnetic field variations, and corona properties interact in these complex systems.","To tackle this problem, a systematic pulse search was conducted using advanced time-series analysis techniques on RXTE/PCA data. The investigation applied the \(Z_{1}^{2}\) method over 25-second intervals with 1-second shifts to scan for millisecond-scale pulsations, with thresholds set to isolate significant pulse candidates. This analysis was complemented by a maximum likelihood (ML) technique, which refined pulse profile modeling and phase shift determination by using \(Z_{1}^{2}\) detections as input. The pulse phases were computed from barycentered photon arrival times using the equation  
\[
\Phi(t) = 2\pi \cdot \nu \cdot t,
\]  
where \(\nu\) is the input spin frequency. The ML method involved grouping phase values into histograms, smoothing them with the S-Bézier method, and normalizing them to form a probability distribution \(P_i(\phi)\) such that  
\[
P_i(\phi) = \frac{I_i}{\Delta \phi \sum_{i=1}^{n} I_i},
\]  
with the further calculation of phase offsets via  
\[
\operatorname{Prob}(\phi_{\text{off}}) = \prod_{i=1}^{N} P_{i}(\phi_i - \phi_{\text{off}}).
\]  
RXTE/PCA’s large effective area (\(6500 \, \mathrm{cm}^2\)) and high time resolution (\(1\,\mu\mathrm{s}\)) allowed for precise temporal analysis across 839, 453, and 268 observation files for Aql X-1, HETE J1900.1-2455, and SAX J1748.9-2021, respectively. Pulse scans were tailored to source-specific frequency ranges—\(550.0-550.5 \, \mathrm{Hz}\) for Aql X-1, \(336.0-338.0 \, \mathrm{Hz}\) for HETE J1900.1-2455, and \(441.0-443.0 \, \mathrm{Hz}\) for SAX J1748.9-2021—using a step size of \(10^{-4}\,\mathrm{Hz}\) with careful smoothing and RMS elimination to exclude false detections.","The analysis revealed 111 initial pulse candidates for Aql X-1, which, after applying an RMS threshold, were reduced to 45 detections with pulse durations ranging from 25 s to 109 s over a total exposure of 2186 ks. For HETE J1900.1-2455, 30 pulse candidates were found from 453 datasets (1128 ks), displaying durations between 27 s and 62 s. SAX J1748.9-2021 produced 21 candidates from 258 datasets (1426 ks) with pulses lasting between 26 s and 661 s. Dynamic power spectra, enhanced by ML-based phase shift analysis, consistently displayed systematic changes in phase offsets attributed to orbital motion, and the updated orbital period for SAX J1748.9-2021 was determined to be \(8.764 \pm 0.001\) hours. Simulations further confirmed the reliability of these detections with single-trial chance probabilities in the range of \(1 \times 10^{-5}\) to \(4 \times 10^{-5}\).","The combination of \(Z_{1}^{2}\) and ML techniques allowed for a detailed reconstruction of intermittent pulsation profiles and revealed a distinctive smooth transition between pulse-on and pulse-off states. ML analysis provided slightly longer pulse durations compared to the \(Z_{1}^{2}\) method, suggesting that pulsation transitions are not abrupt but occur gradually. This nuance is likely influenced by the inhomogeneous nature of the Comptonized corona, variations in magnetic field strength, and accretion turbulence, all of which affect pulse amplitude and visibility. The observed phase offsets, evolving systematically with orbital motion, underscore the effectiveness of the ML approach in determining precise orbital parameters.","These findings have significant implications for our understanding of accretion physics in LMXBs and the mechanisms that drive intermittent pulsations. By demonstrating that ML techniques yield improved precision over conventional \(Z_{1}^{2}\) methods in discerning the subtle transitions of pulse dynamics, the study opens avenues for more accurate modeling of neutron star environments. The ability to reliably extract orbital parameters and capture the transient nature of pulsations enhances our knowledge of magnetic field interactions and the role of the Comptonizing corona in pulse suppression. This work contributes to a broader comprehension of the complex interplay between accretion processes and pulsation phenomena in neutron star systems."
2502.03834,Estimating the evolution and the content fractions of baryonic gas for Luminous Infrared Galaxies,M. N. Al Najm et al.,"Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) are astrophysical laboratories that provide valuable insights into the evolution of galaxies. These systems, with infrared luminosities ranging from \(10^{11}\) to \(10^{12}\) solar luminosities, derive their energy from intense star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity. Mergers, which are frequent in such galaxies, play a key role in driving these energetic processes, making LIRGs essential for studying the complex interplay between galaxy evolution and the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Previous research has established their importance in explaining high-redshift quasars and the relationship between galaxies and central black holes.","The primary motivation of the study is to improve our understanding of how gas content evolves within LIRGs and to determine the fractions of baryonic gas that contribute to ongoing star formation and galaxy evolution. By examining the molecular-to-atomic hydrogen ratios, dust-to-stellar mass variations, and gas mass fractions, the study aims to shed light on the processes responsible for gas depletion and star formation shutdown. The investigation also seeks to clarify the connections between optical properties, gas dynamics, and chemical enrichment, which are pivotal in delineating the life cycle of galaxies.","To achieve these goals, the study analyzed a sample of 82 Luminous Infrared Galaxies using extensive datasets from SDSS DR17, NED, and HyperLEDA. Key observational parameters such as morphological types, B-band diameters, H I magnitudes, radial velocities, color filters (g and r bands), extinction values, and inclination angles were obtained, while ALMA observations of NGC 7679 provided additional insight into a representative LIRG. The methodology involved detailed spectral extraction and calibration processes, as well as precise determination of several fundamental quantities. Stellar mass (\(M_{\text{star}}\)), star formation rate (SFR), dust mass (\(M_{\text{dust}}\)), baryonic mass, and dynamical mass (\(M_{\text{dyn}}\)) were derived using optical colors and mass-to-light ratios (\(\Upsilon^*\)). The photometric distance \(D\) was computed based on the post-Hubble relation incorporating radial velocity \(V_{3k}\) and cosmological constants \(\Omega_m = 0.308\), \(\Omega_\Lambda = 0.692\), and \(q_0 = -0.55\). Key formulas included the estimation of neutral hydrogen mass from 21-cm line flux, dust temperature derivations from FIR fluxes at 60 and 100 \(\mu m\), and the calculation of gas depletion time \(\tau_{\text{dep}} = M_{\text{gas}} / \text{SFR}\). The study also utilized relationships linking CO emissions at rotational transitions \(J=1 \rightarrow 0\), \(J=2 \rightarrow 1\), and \(J=3 \rightarrow 2\) with molecular gas masses as functions of stellar mass, expressed as \(\log M_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}\left(M_{\odot}\right)=\log M^{*, V}-1.16\). These rigorous observational and analytical methods allowed for a comprehensive analysis of gas fractions and chemical evolution in LIRGs.","The analysis revealed several important correlations in LIRGs. A key finding is that the molecular-to-atomic hydrogen mass ratio \(\left(M_{\mathrm{H}_{2}} / M_{\mathrm{HI}}\right)\) correlates with morphological types, gas mass fractions, and other galaxy characteristics such as color and luminosity. In particular, late-type galaxies exhibit molecular gas masses significantly lower compared to atomic gas, while early-type galaxies show the opposite trend, with the ratio generally decreasing with increasing Hubble type \(T\). The study also identified that dust-to-stellar content ratios decline as gas is consumed for star formation, whereas the gas mass fraction \(f_{\text{gas}}\) increases with decreasing stellar mass. A strong inverse relationship was observed between gas mass fraction and stellar mass, with galaxies having \(M^{*, V} \geq 10^{10} M_{\odot}\) displaying low gas fractions (\(f_{\text{gas}} \leq 0.3\)) and showing shorter gas depletion times compared to the Hubble time. This suggests that high \(f_{\text{gas}}\) in less massive galaxies is maintained either by rapid gas accretion or inefficient conversion into stars. The work further details correlations between dust mass (\(M_{\text{dust}} \approx 5.4 \times 10^{6} M_{\odot}\)), stellar mass, and SFR, indicating that dust is transformed into stars over time. Additionally, relationships between gas fraction and galaxy color indices indicate a negative correlation with \((B-V)_{\text{corrected}}\) (regression of -0.3 with a standard error of 0.1) while showing moderate correlation with absolute magnitude \(M_B\). The study’s detailed use of formulas—such as the estimation of helium mass \(M_{\mathrm{He}}\) as \(0.33\left(M_{\mathrm{H}_{I}}+M_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}\right)\) and the modeling of metallicity dependence through \(\phi = 0.75 - 38.2\left(\frac{M^{*, V}}{M_o}\right)^\alpha\) with \(\alpha = 0.22\) and \(M_o = 1.5 \times 10^{24} M_\odot\)—underscores the robustness of the derived relationships and their implications for gas dynamics in these galaxies.","The results point to a nuanced understanding of how gas dynamics interplay with star formation and the evolutionary stages of LIRGs. The variations in the molecular-to-atomic gas ratio across morphological types indicate that inherent structural differences strongly influence gas content and its conversion into stars. The inverse relationship between stellar mass and gas mass fraction, coupled with the rapid reduction in gas depletion time for more massive galaxies, suggests that these systems are on the brink of exhausting their star-forming fuel. This is further supported by the observed flattening in the \(M_{\text{dust}}-M^{*, V}\) relationship at higher stellar masses, indicating possible dust loss or conversion inefficiencies. Moreover, the integration of metallicity into the analysis provides evidence that chemical evolution plays a crucial role, as seen in the relation \(\phi = 0.75 - 38.2(\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{H})\), which links elemental abundances with overall gas content. Collectively, these findings challenge the notion of continuous gas accretion in massive LIRGs and highlight a state of advanced gas depletion and reduced star formation efficiency.","The implications of this study are significant for our broader understanding of galaxy evolution. By establishing clear correlations between gas content, star formation, stellar mass, and chemical enrichment, the work suggests that there is a critical mass threshold—around \(M^{*, V} \approx 10^{10} M_{\odot}\)—beyond which galaxies begin to shut down star formation due to rapid gas depletion. This mechanism may help to explain the observed diversity in galaxy properties and the transitional phases leading to quiescent systems. The methodological framework and detailed analysis of LIRGs offer a valuable template for further studies, potentially guiding future observations and theoretical models that aim to untangle the complex processes governing galaxy evolution."
2502.04292,Magnetic Reconnection in a Compact Magnetic Dome: Peculiar Emissions and High-velocity Plasma Flows,J. M. Da Silva Santos et al.,"This study is set against the backdrop of small-scale magnetic reconnection events in the solar atmosphere, phenomena that include features such as Ellerman bombs (EBs) and UV bursts (UVBs). These transient, sub-arcsecond events are often observed in regions where opposite magnetic polarities interact, and they exhibit intricate spectral signatures and dynamic outflows. Prior investigations have raised questions regarding the magnetic topology and the reconnection mechanisms—whether through tearing mode instabilities, turbulent reconnection, or plasmoid dynamics—that underlie these observed behaviors. Recent advances in high-resolution solar telescopes and multi-wavelength imaging have enabled the detailed exploration of such events, linking them to more general flare processes and complex magnetic field configurations like U-type separatrices and fan-spine topologies.","The primary motivation of this work is to investigate a small-scale brightening observed in an active region and to understand its underlying mechanisms through both thermal and nonthermal channels. The study specifically aims to analyze the role of flux cancellation, the emergence of magnetic features, and their connectivity in driving plasma dynamics that lead to multi-wavelength emissions. By leveraging high-resolution observations and advanced modeling techniques, the research seeks to decipher the interplay between magnetic topology, energy release, and resulting plasma flows, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of low-altitude reconnection processes in the solar atmosphere.","This investigation utilizes high-resolution data from the DKIST facilities, employing both the Visible Broadband Imager (VBI) and the Visible Spectro-Polarimeter (ViSP) to capture detailed images and spectropolarimetric measurements in multiple wavelengths including G-band, \(\mathrm{H} \beta\), Ca II K, Fe I 6301/6302 Å, Na I D 5896 Å, and Ca II 8542 Å. Data processing included dark- and gain-corrections and the removal of seeing distortions via speckle algorithms. For magnetic field analysis, Milne–Eddington (ME) inversions were applied to the Fe I lines, while the Weak Field Approximation (WFA) was used for the Na I and Ca II cores. Additionally, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) inversions were executed with the STiC code, incorporating both 11-level Na I and 5-level Ca II atomic models to assess temperature, velocity, and microturbulence variations across the upper photosphere and lower chromosphere. Magnetic field extrapolations were performed using a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) to construct three-dimensional NLFFF models. This method combined high-resolution ViSP vector magnetograms with SDO/HMI observations, sampling a large number of points and enforcing force-free conditions to characterize properties such as current density, the squashing factor \(Q\), and the twist number \(\mathcal{T}_{w}\).","Observational data revealed a small-scale negative polarity patch emerging near the sunspot penumbra with a peak detection at 19:40 UT and a plane-of-sky velocity of \(1.8 \pm 0.3 \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\), indicative of moving magnetic features (MMFs). Flux cancellation occurred at a rate of \(d\Phi/dt \sim 3 \times 10^{15} \, \mathrm{Mx} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\) while AIA 1700 Å emissions increased after a lag of 11.3 minutes, leaving a linear correlation with a factor of \(r=0.75\). VBI imagery captured EB-like ""flame"" structures in \(\mathrm{H} \beta\) and, notably, a unique annular brightening in Ca II K that evolved into a ring with a full width at half maximum of approximately \(0.11^{\prime \prime}\) and an equivalent diameter varying between \(0.4^{\prime \prime}\) and \(0.65^{\prime \prime}\). High-resolution G-band observations detailed the motion of bright filigree converging at granule apices and highlighted moving blobs with sizes ranging from \(0.1^{\prime \prime}\) to \(0.4^{\prime \prime}\). NLTE inversions revealed temperature enhancements on the order of \(\sim 100-2000 \, \mathrm{K}\) in the photosphere (around \(\log \tau \sim -2\)) with a dome-like heating feature at \(\log \tau \sim -3\), as well as significant bidirectional flows with downflows near \(-18 \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\) and upflows reaching \(\sim 28 \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\) at supersonic speeds. Additionally, microturbulence values peaked at around \(14 \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\) in the higher atmospheric layers, and the inferred radiative energy losses of the low chromosphere were estimated at \(\sim 70 \, \mathrm{kW} \, \mathrm{m}^{-2}\), with a total energy release of \(\sim 10^{27} \, \mathrm{erg}\) over an approximately 5-minute period. Magnetic field extrapolations disclosed a compact, low-lying dome structure with a fan-spine magnetic configuration, featuring a null point at roughly \(500 \, \mathrm{km}\) above the photosphere and displaying high squashing factors (\(Q \sim 10^{2}-10^{4}\)) along quasi-separatrix layers.","The comprehensive set of observations and analyses suggests that the detected annular Ca II K structure is likely the manifestation of a heated magnetic dome associated with a fan-spine topology. The observed flux cancellation, along with the emergence and motion of small-scale magnetic patches, underscores the role of magnetic reconnection in this region. The NLTE inversion results, with their detailed temperature and velocity diagnostics, indicate that localized heating and dynamic plasma flows are intimately linked to the magnetic topology, particularly in regions where a low-altitude null point and high \(Q\) values delineate reconnection sites. The bidirectional flows, significant Doppler shifts, and enhanced microturbulence are interpreted as signatures of energy release through reconnection, possibly supported by nonthermal particle contributions that could explain the peculiar spectral characteristics such as the observed asymmetries and differences between \(\mathrm{H} \beta\) and Ca II K emissions.","These findings have important implications for our understanding of low-altitude solar reconnection events. The intricate interplay between magnetic topology, demonstrated by the fan-spine configuration and quasi-separatrix layers, and the energy release processes provides crucial insight into how small-scale events may contribute to larger atmospheric phenomena. The evidence for nonthermal effects, complementing the thermal signatures observed in the spectral lines, stresses the importance of integrating high-cadence, multi-wavelength observations with advanced inversion and extrapolation techniques. Such an integrated approach not only enhances our comprehension of magnetic reconnection at sub-arcsecond scales but also lays the groundwork for future studies aiming to discern the thermal and nonthermal contributions in similar astrophysical contexts."
2502.04089,Revisiting symbiotic binaries with interferometry,Jaroslav Merc et al.,"Symbiotic stars, composed of a cool giant and a compact accretor—typically a white dwarf or neutron star—have long been key laboratories for studying mass transfer processes in interacting binary systems. Historically, estimates based on spectral types and rotational velocities have indicated that these giants exhibit low Roche-lobe filling factors, yet the presence of ellipsoidal variability in many systems points towards a more complex scenario. Previous investigations have relied on indirect methods of radius estimation, creating an ambiguity in understanding whether mass transfer occurs primarily via Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF), stellar winds, or a combination of both.","The central motivation for this study arises from the persistent discrepancy between inferred low Roche-lobe filling factors from traditional methods and the apparent ellipsoidal variability observed in several symbiotic systems. This paradox challenges existing models of binary mass transfer and calls for more direct, model-independent measurements. With the advent of high-resolution interferometric observations in tandem with precise Gaia distance estimates, the researchers aimed to resolve this tension by directly assessing the physical dimensions of the giant components in these systems and reevaluating their filling factors relative to their Roche lobes.","The study reanalyzed archival VLTI/PIONIER data acquired between 2012 and 2019 for six symbiotic stars: AG Peg, FG Ser, ER Del, V1261 Ori, RW Hya, and V399 Pav. Data reduction was performed using the pndrs package, resulting in squared visibilities and closure phases that were consistent with zero and indicative of symmetric brightness distributions. Angular diameters were derived using the PMOIRED tool, with both uniform disk and limb-darkened models tested. The authors adopted the Claret & Southworth power-2 law for limb darkening, which yielded marginally more realistic estimates. The fitting process was validated by reduced \(\chi^{2}\) values, confirming the reliability of assuming symmetric models and negligible \(H\)-band flux contributions from either the companions or circumstellar material. Gaia DR3 distances further refined the linear radii estimates, providing a robust framework for analyzing Roche-lobe filling factors.","Measurements indicate that, for the investigated systems, the giants generally reside well within their Roche lobes. For instance, AG Peg has an M3 giant with a linear radius of \(R_{\mathrm{G}}=151.3_{-7.9}^{+8.7}\,R_{\odot}\), filling approximately 56% of its Roche lobe at its nominal distance, a result consistent with the absence of ellipsoidal variability. Similarly, FG Ser displays an M5 giant with a radius of \(R_{\mathrm{G}}=157.1_{-12.8}^{+14.8}\,R_{\odot}\) and a Roche-lobe filling factor ranging from 65% to 87%, while its luminosity and position in the H–R diagram suggest an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) mass near \(2.0\pm0.3\,M_{\odot}\). Further results for ER Del, with its 2081-day period and slightly eccentric orbit (\(e=0.28\)), indicate a giant radius of \(141.5_{-8.9}^{+9.9}\,R_{\odot}\). In the case of V1261 Ori, Gaia data imply a giant radius of approximately \(97.8_{-4.5}^{+5.0}\,R_{\odot}\) (or larger when considering Hipparcos measurements) and a Roche-lobe filling of only 50–75%, despite photometric evidence for eclipses and variability that would normally require near-full filling. RW Hya, an M2 giant, exhibits a radius on the order of \(106.5_{-7.0}^{+7.8}\,R_{\odot}\) based on Gaia DR3 distances, although various estimates span a wide range, and V399 Pav, with an M5 giant, is inferred to have a substantially larger radius (\(197.4_{-35.7}^{+48.4}\,R_{\odot}\)) at a distance of 3.5 kpc. In many cases, inferred masses based on spectral diagnostics, orbital dynamics, and He II line analysis indicate potential overestimations of the mass ratios, and measurements of \(v_{\mathrm{rot}} \sin i\) suggest that the giants are not synchronized with their orbital motions. These detailed interferometric and astrometric results challenge previous assumptions regarding the mass transfer mechanisms in these systems.","The interferometric measurements combined with Gaia distances provide compelling evidence that nearly all studied giant components remain well inside their Roche lobes, even in cases where ellipsoidal variability is observed. This paradox may signal the presence of modified Roche lobe dynamics or indicate that dense stellar winds, rather than direct Roche-lobe overflow, may be responsible for the mass-transfer phenomena. The fact that rotation appears unsynchronized, as demonstrated by the significantly lower \(v_{\mathrm{rot}} \sin i\) values compared to predicted synchronization speeds (e.g., in AG Peg and FG Ser), further reinforces the notion that traditional tidal interaction models might underestimate the complexity of these systems. Moreover, the discrepancies in mass ratio estimates obtained from He II line measurements versus those inferred from other methods indicate that emission line diagnostics could be biased. The influence of binary motion on Gaia astrometry, particularly when the orbital periods are close to one year, adds an additional layer of complexity, as evidence by simulations showing deviations up to \(1.5{-}2\) mas in parallax measurements for systems with active binary motion.","These results have significant implications for our understanding of mass transfer in symbiotic binaries. They suggest that the customary interpretation of ellipsoidal variability as a direct indicator of Roche-lobe filling may need to be reconsidered in light of potential alterations in Roche geometry or the impact of dense, non-spherical winds. The study underscores the importance of employing high-resolution interferometry together with precise Gaia astrometry to achieve a more accurate picture of binary star interactions. Furthermore, the simulation of Gaia’s astrometric performance on a large population of symbiotic binaries highlights the limitations of a single-star astrometric model in capturing the true dynamics of these systems. This work paves the way for revising mass transfer models in interacting binaries and calls for more sophisticated analyses that account for the intricate interplay between stellar wind dynamics, binary orbital motion, and atmospheric phenomena."
2502.03833,Properties of the emission region in pulsars with opposite subpulse drift directions in different profile components,H. M. Tedila et al.,"Pulsar observations have long provided insight into the rotating carousel model, in which subpulse drifting is explained by the motion of subbeams due to the \(\boldsymbol{E} \times \boldsymbol{B}\) drift. In several pulsars, however, such as PSR J0815+0939 and PSR J1819+1305, the observed subpulses drift in opposite directions across different profile components, a phenomenon that challenges the traditional view of a singular emission state in the carousel model. Further complications arise with additional observational evidence including pulse nulling and phase-dependent emission changes that imply multiple, coexisting emission states within the pulsar magnetosphere. These observations have necessitated reexamining pulsar emission mechanisms, particularly in view of non-uniform subpulse organization and potential variations in plasma flow dynamics.","The study is driven by the need to reconcile the conflicting observational evidence of opposite subpulse drift directions with existing models of pulsar emission. Traditional interpretations based on a single corotational plasma state are insufficient when drift reversals are observed. Instead, a more comprehensive framework is warranted—one that considers multiple coexisting emission states parameterized by a factor \(y\) that influences the local \(\boldsymbol{E}\) field, and consequently, the plasma flow. By determining the values of \(y\) from drift parameters and exploring variations in the number of emission regions \(m\), the work aims to provide new insights into the spatial and temporal properties of pulsar emission regions and the underlying physical mechanisms that produce the observed subpulse drift phenomena.","The approach is based on a modification of the rotating carousel model by incorporating multiple emission states, represented by a parameter \(y\) in the range \([0,1]\). In the model, plasma subpulses drift as a result of the \(\boldsymbol{E} \times \boldsymbol{B}\) effect, with the electric field in the magnetosphere described as  
\[
\boldsymbol{E}=(1-y\,\boldsymbol{b} \boldsymbol{b})\cdot\boldsymbol{E}_{\mathrm{ind}}+(1-y)\,\boldsymbol{E}_{\mathrm{pot}},
\]
where the potential part is given by \(\boldsymbol{E}_{\mathrm{pot}}=-\operatorname{grad}\Phi_{\text{cor}}\) and the inductive electric field \(\boldsymbol{E}_{\mathrm{ind}}\) originates from the obliquely rotating magnetic dipole. The model further explains that for \(y=0\), the plasma experiences pure corotation, while for \(y=1\) the inductive component is screened by a minimal charge density \(\rho_{\min}\). The overall screening charge density is expressed as  
\[
\rho_{\mathrm{sn}}=y\,\rho_{\min}+(1-y)\,\rho_{\mathrm{GJ}},
\]
with \(\rho_{\mathrm{GJ}}=-\varepsilon_{0}\operatorname{div}\boldsymbol{E}_{\mathrm{cor}}\). The drift velocity is given by  
\[
\boldsymbol{v}_{\mathrm{dr}}=\frac{\boldsymbol{E}\times\boldsymbol{B}}{B^{2}}=y\,\boldsymbol{v}_{\mathrm{ind}}+(1-y)\,\boldsymbol{v}_{\mathrm{cor}},
\]
and the corresponding angular velocity is  
\[
\boldsymbol{\omega}_{\mathrm{dr}}=y\,\boldsymbol{\omega}_{\mathrm{ind}}+(1-y)\,\boldsymbol{\omega}_{\mathrm{cor}}.
\]
Emission is assumed to originate from \(m\) discrete, overdense plasma areas arranged in a pattern proportional to \(\cos(m\phi_b)\) around the magnetic axis, with the visible emission determined by the observer’s trajectory through the magnetosphere. The study utilizes simulations applied to three pulsars — PSRs B0525+21, B1929+10, and B0052+51 — separating each pulse profile into regions A and B. By systematically varying \(m\) (between 1 and 45) and \(y\) (between 0 and 1), the simulations calculate \(\omega_{\mathrm{dr}}\), \(\omega_{\mathrm{cor}}\), and the visible angular speed \(\omega_{\mathrm{V}}\) along the observed trajectory. The subpulse drift rate, defined as \(P_{2}/P_{3}\) where \(P_{2}\) is the horizontal separation and \(P_{3}\) the repetition period, is matched against observed values to extract weighted averages for the parameters. Additional considerations include transformations between coordinate systems for emission geometry, ensuring the model accounts for variations in observer angles \(\zeta\) and the magnetic inclination \(\alpha\).","The simulations demonstrate that opposite subpulse drifting is achieved by variations in the emission state parameter \(y\) and the number of emission regions \(m\) across different profile components. For PSR B0525+21, the ratio \(\omega_{\mathrm{dr}}/\omega_{\mathrm{cor}}\) is found to average \(0.98\) in region A and \(1.05\) in region B, clearly indicating opposite drift directions. Similarly, PSR B0052+51 exhibits ratios of \(0.93\) and \(1.05\), while PSR B1929+10 shows values of \(1.14\) and \(0.89\) in its respective profile components. The observed drift rates \(P_{2}/P_{3}\) are consistent with these angular velocity deviations and yield average \(y\) values of approximately \(0.24\), \(0.62\), and \(0.58\) for the three pulsars. The simulations further reveal that while the number of subpulse emission regions \(m\) varies (for example, \(28 \pm 3\) for PSR B0525+21), there is no consistent correlation of \(m\) with \(y\) or the pulsar inclination angle \(\alpha\). Derived charge densities \(\rho_{\mathrm{sn}}\), calculated using the determined \(y\) values, deviate from the classical Goldreich-Julian value and show an uneven spatial distribution across the emission zone, underscoring a non-uniform plasma environment.","The results imply that pulsars can host multiple coexisting emission states within their magnetospheres, each characterized by distinct plasma drift rates due to different values of \(y\). The occurrence of opposite drift directions in different profile components is naturally explained by localized variations in the screening of the inductive electric field, leading to differences in the plasma flow. Moreover, the variation in subpulse numbers \(m\) across the pulsar sample, which appears to be independent of both the emission state and the obliquity angle \(\alpha\), suggests that the carousel structures are inherently pulsar-dependent rather than governed by universal parameters. The relationship between subpulse distribution and the local charge density \(\rho_{\mathrm{sn}}\) further emphasizes that non-uniform plasma densities play a key role in shaping the observed emission patterns. Additionally, evidence of temporal changes in emission states, as demonstrated by drift-mode switching in other pulsars like PSR B0031-07, reinforces the view that the same underlying mechanism is responsible for both opposite subpulse drifting and time-dependent changes in drift behavior.","This work advances our understanding of pulsar emission mechanisms by demonstrating that multiple, coexisting emission states can coexist within a single pulsar magnetosphere and that variations in these states are responsible for the phenomenon of opposite subpulse drifting. The findings challenge the traditional view of a uniform rotating carousel and highlight the sensitivity of plasma flow to localized electric field variations. By linking measurable drift rates to underlying physical parameters such as \(y\) and \(m\), the study not only provides deeper insight into the structure and dynamics of the emission region but also opens new avenues for investigating pulsar magnetospheric physics. The results imply that future high-sensitivity observations with instruments like FAST and SKA might reveal even more complexity in subpulse drift patterns, thereby further illuminating the interplay between charge density variations, plasma flow, and pulsar geometry in shaping radio emission."
