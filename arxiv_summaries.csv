2502.03778,Self-Supervised Learning for Solar Radio Spectrum Classification,Siqi Li et al.,"Solar radio bursts provide crucial insights into solar activity and space weather phenomena. Traditional deep learning methods for their classification require extensive labeled training data, often addressed via transfer learning. However, the disparity between natural images and solar radio spectra limits transfer learning effectiveness. Solar broadband radio spectrometers (SBRS) at the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences generate vast observational data, but the rarity and noise contamination of solar radio bursts complicate automated classification.","The surge in solar radio spectral data necessitates automated detection and classification for efficient solar physics research and space weather forecasting. Existing deep learning approaches face challenges due to data scarcity and the domain gap between natural and solar images. Self-supervised learning (SSL), inspired by methods like BERT in natural language processing, offers a solution by leveraging unlabeled data to learn essential features, reducing reliance on labeled datasets and improving transfer learning applicability.","The proposed self-supervised learning method adapts self-masking from BERT to solar radio spectrum classification. Solar radio spectrum images are divided into blocks, randomly masked, and processed by a Vision Transformer (ViT) network comprising an encoder and decoder. The encoder processes unmasked blocks, while the decoder reconstructs the image. Preprocessing includes frequency channel normalization using the formula:  
\[
p^{\prime}(x, y)=p(x, y)-\frac{1}{n} \sum_{y=0}^{n} p(x, y)+\frac{1}{m n} \sum_{x=0}^{m} \sum_{y=0}^{n} p(x, y)
\]  
to reduce transverse stripe noise. Data augmentation techniques like mixup, which linearly interpolates images and labels with a Beta-distributed parameter \(\lambda\), and dropout methods (DropPath, DropAttention) are employed to mitigate overfitting. Experiments used a dataset of 5519 samples (4415 training, 1104 testing) with polarization-separated classes. Training configurations included pre-training for 300 epochs (learning rate \(1.5 \times 10^{-4}\)) and fine-tuning for 50 epochs (learning rate \(10^{-3}\)) on an NVidia GeForce RTX 2080Ti GPU.","A masking rate of 75% yielded optimal accuracy, contrasting with BERT’s 15%, due to higher redundancy in images. Transfer learning from ImageNet improved accuracy from 70.60% to 98.63%. Mixup and cutmix augmentation achieved 99.3% accuracy, while DropPath regularization (0.1 drop probability) achieved 98.9% accuracy. The final model achieved 99.5% accuracy, 99.5% precision, 98.9% recall, and 99.7% specificity for burst classification, outperforming Vision Transformer, ResNet, and other benchmarks.","High masking rates enhance feature learning by removing redundant and irrelevant data, enabling the model to focus on discriminative features. Self-supervised pre-training extracts richer image information than supervised methods, improving transfer learning efficacy. Mixup and cutmix augmentations improve generalization by simulating diverse training samples, while DropPath regularization prevents overfitting by randomly dropping network paths.","This method addresses the scarcity of labeled solar radio spectra and demonstrates SSL’s potential for small-sample astronomical data classification. Future work will optimize model scale for reduced training time and extend the approach to fine-grained classification of solar radio burst types (I, II, III, IV, V), advancing the understanding of solar physical phenomena and space weather forecasting."
2502.04091,Asymmetry at Low Surface Brightness as an Indicator of Environmental Processes in the Fornax Cluster,X. Xu et al.,"The \(\Lambda\)CDM model underpins cosmic structure formation, where larger galaxies emerge hierarchically through mergers and accretion of smaller systems. Dwarf galaxies, forming slowly in low-mass halos, are crucial for studying galaxy evolution due to their sensitivity to environmental effects. The morphology-density relation shows that galaxy morphology varies with local density, with elliptical fractions increasing in denser regions. Galaxy clusters like Fornax provide ideal settings to study environmental mechanisms such as ram-pressure stripping, tidal distortion, and harassment, which drive morphological transformations. Quantifying galaxy morphology has evolved from visual classifications to parametric and non-parametric methods like the CAS (Concentration, Asymmetry, Smoothness) system, which is effective for irregular galaxies. The Fornax cluster, the second most massive within 20 Mpc, offers a unique environment to study galaxy evolution due to its proximity and complex structure, with surveys like the Fornax Deep Survey (FDS) providing deep multi-wavelength data.","The Fornax cluster, with its dense core and strong tidal fields, serves as an ideal environment to study the impact of cluster dynamics on dwarf galaxy morphology. Using the Fornax Deep Survey (FDS), this work aims to analyze environmental effects on dwarf galaxies through asymmetry and smoothness parameters, leveraging deep imaging to explore mechanisms like ram pressure stripping and tidal interactions. The study seeks to understand how these processes drive morphological transformations, particularly in transitioning dwarfs toward quiescence, and to provide insights for future surveys like Euclid.","Morphologies of 556 dwarf galaxies in the Fornax cluster are quantified using asymmetry (\(A\)) and smoothness (\(S\)) parameters. Asymmetry measures rotational symmetry by rotating a galaxy by \(180^{\circ}\) and subtracting the rotated image from the original:  
\[
A=\frac{\sum\left(I_{0}-I_{\theta}\right)}{2 \sum\left|I_{0}\right|}-A_{b g r},
\]  
where \(I_{0}\) is the original image, \(I_{\theta}\) is the rotated image, and \(A_{b g r}\) is background asymmetry. Smoothness measures small-scale structure:  
\[
S=10 \times \sum_{x, y=1,1}^{N, N} \frac{\left(I_{x, y}-I_{x, y}^{\sigma}\right)-B_{x, y}}{I_{x, y}},
\]  
where \(I_{x, y}^{\sigma}\) is the smoothed image, and \(B_{x, y}\) is the smoothed background. Asymmetry profiles are analyzed in elliptical annuli across \(g\), \(r\), and \(i\) bands, with background subtraction performed by masking sources and fitting a sky model \(z=C_{1}(x-x_{0})+C_{2}(y-y_{0})+C_{0}\). Data from the FDS Dwarf Galaxy Catalogue (FDSDC), reaching a surface brightness limit of \(\bar{\mu}_{e, r'} = 26 \mathrm{mag} \operatorname{arcsec}^{-2}\), are used to ensure robust measurements.","Analysis of 556 dwarf galaxies reveals higher asymmetry in outer (\(R > 1 \mathrm{Mpc}\)) and very central (\(R \leq 0.12 \mathrm{Mpc}\)) regions, linked to ram pressure stripping and tidal effects, respectively. Asymmetry increases with fainter magnitudes (\(M_{r'}\)) and bluer colors, while smoothness decreases with stellar mass. Phase-space analysis shows elevated asymmetry near pericentre, indicating morphological disturbances during first pericentric passages. Low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies show no clear asymmetry correlation, suggesting galaxy size or other factors dominate. Simulations using \(r\)-band FDS data reveal detection bias for dwarfs within 10 kpc of NGC 1399, with minimal impact on overall results.","Outer-region asymmetry is attributed to ram pressure stripping and harassment, scaling with \(\rho_{\mathrm{ICM}} v_{\mathrm{rel}}^{2}\), while inner-region asymmetry aligns with tidal perturbations. Phase-space diagrams classify galaxies by infall history, with higher asymmetry in pericentre regions (Region B) suggesting disruption during first passages. Ancient infallers (Region E) show slightly elevated asymmetry, while backsplash galaxies (Region D) exhibit transient asymmetry. Inner-region asymmetry challenges \(\Lambda\)CDM predictions in some cases, potentially requiring alternative models. Bright galaxies’ asymmetry hints at dust influence, while faint galaxies’ susceptibility reflects environmental effects like harassment and tidal stripping.","The findings highlight the transitional phase of dwarf galaxies evolving toward quiescence under environmental processes in the Fornax cluster. Outer-region dwarfs retain active star formation, while inner-region dwarfs experience tidal quenching. The results underscore the role of cluster dynamics in shaping morphology, with implications for understanding galaxy evolution in dense environments. Future work will extend this analysis to other clusters using Euclid ERO data and studies like Marleau et al. (2024), advancing our knowledge of environmental effects across cosmic time."
2502.03684,Iron-corrected Single-epoch Black Hole Masses of DESI Quasars at low redshift,Zhiwei Pan et al.,"Quasars, powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs), are critical for understanding SMBH growth. Reliable SMBH mass measurements often rely on broad emission lines like \(\mathrm{H} \beta\) and Mg II, using the virial assumption and the radius-luminosity (\(R-L\)) relation. While reverberation mapping (RM) provides robust mass estimates, single-epoch methods calibrated against RM are more practical but less precise. Recent evidence suggests scatter in the \(R-L\) relation due to accretion states and iron emission, necessitating corrections for improved accuracy.","Canonical single-epoch SMBH mass measurements may overestimate masses, particularly for high-redshift quasars, creating tensions in early SMBH growth scenarios. This study aims to address these overestimations by incorporating iron emission strength as a tracer of the Eddington ratio, recalibrating \(\mathrm{H} \beta\)- and Mg II-based \(R-L\) relations using a large DESI quasar sample. The goal is to reconcile discrepancies in SMBH mass-growth history and provide more reliable estimators for high-redshift populations.","We analyze over 55,000 DESI quasars (\(0.25<z<0.8\)) with high signal-to-noise ratios (\(\mathrm{TSNR}_{\mathrm{QSO}}>25\)) and robust spectral fits. Spectral fitting using DASpec models power-law continua, Fe II pseudo-continua, and emission lines (\(\mathrm{H} \beta\), Mg II, [O III]) across optical (3750–5500 Å) and UV (2200–4260 Å) windows. The iron-corrected \(R-L\) relation for \(\mathrm{H} \beta\) is \(\log \left(R_{\mathrm{H} \beta} / \mathrm{ltd}\right)=1.65+0.45 \log l_{44}-0.35 R_{\mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{H} \beta}\), where \(R_{\mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{H} \beta}\) quantifies iron strength. A combined \(\mathrm{H} \beta\)-Mg II sample (\(0.65<z<0.8\)) calibrates Mg II-based masses using the relation \(\log \left(R_{\mathrm{Mg}_{\text{II}}} / \mathrm{ltd}\right) \sim 0.46 \log l_{44}-0.34 R_{\mathrm{Fe}}\). Systematic uncertainties (e.g., Fe II template choice, host galaxy contamination) are propagated into error estimates, with virial \(f\)-factor scatter (\(\sim 0.3\) dex) identified as a major limitation.","Iron-corrected \(\mathrm{H} \beta\)-based SMBH masses reduce canonical estimates by 0.16 dex (factor of 1.5) on average, reaching 0.7 dex (factor of 5) for super-Eddington quasars. The super-Eddington fraction rises from \(0.4\%\) to \(\sim 5\%\). Mg II masses calibrated against iron-corrected \(\mathrm{H} \beta\) masses show similar corrections, with a mean offset of 0.03 dex and scatter of 0.24 dex. Applying this to \(\sim 0.5\) million DESI quasars (\(0.6<z<1.6\)), we predict high-redshift (\(z \geq 6\)) SMBH mass overestimations by a factor of 2.3. Both \(R_{\mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{H} \beta}\) and \(R_{\mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{Mg} \text{II}}\) anti-correlate with \(\mathrm{FWHM}\) and [O III] equivalent width, consistent with Eigenvector 1 trends.","The overestimation arises because canonical \(R-L\) relations neglect iron emission’s dependence on accretion states. Iron strength (\(R_{\mathrm{Fe}}\)) reliably traces the Eddington ratio, with stronger Fe II emission indicating higher accretion rates. This correction aligns \(\mathrm{FWHM}_{\mathrm{H} \beta}\) and \(\mathrm{FWHM}_{\mathrm{Fe}}\) kinematics, suggesting Fe II originates in intermediate-width regions inflowing toward the SMBH. Discrepancies between Mg II and \(\mathrm{H} \beta\) masses stem from the sub-linear \(\mathrm{FWHM}_{\mathrm{Mg} \text{II}}\)-\(\mathrm{FWHM}_{\mathrm{H} \beta}\) relation. Systematic uncertainties (\(\sim 0.4\)–0.5 dex) dominate over measurement errors, emphasizing the need for iron-corrected calibrations.","Current high-redshift (\(z \geq 6\)) SMBH mass estimates may be overestimated by \(\sim 0.4\) dex, alleviating tensions in massive seed formation scenarios. JWST observations of high-Eddington AGNs in the early universe could benefit from iron-corrected \(R-L\) relations, potentially reducing inferred masses and easing growth challenges. Future reverberation mapping and interferometric studies will refine virial \(f\)-factors and iron templates, enabling more precise SMBH mass estimators across cosmic time."
2502.04246,Multi-fidelity emulator for large-scale 21 cm lightcone images: a few-shot transfer learning approach with generative adversarial network,Kangning Diao et al.,"Machine learning emulators, particularly generative adversarial networks (GANs), provide a computationally efficient alternative to large-scale numerical simulations for generating mock data from upcoming surveys. However, as simulations scale to hundreds of megaparsecs, high-fidelity emulators become prohibitively expensive. Traditional methods face challenges in balancing computational costs with the need for accuracy in emulating large-scale astrophysical structures.","The need to address the prohibitive computational costs of high-fidelity emulators for large-scale 21 cm lightcone images from the epoch of reionization (EoR) motivates this work. Existing approaches require extensive computational resources, making them impractical for generating large datasets. A cost-effective method is needed to maintain precision while reducing resource demands.","The paper introduces a multi-fidelity emulation technique using few-shot transfer learning with GANs. A GAN is first trained on 120,000 small-scale images (resolution \((64,64,512)\), comoving length \((128,128,1024) \mathrm{Mpc}\)) generated via 21CMFAST simulations, then fine-tuned on 320 large-scale images (resolution \((256,256,512)\), comoving length \((512,512,1024) \mathrm{Mpc}\)). The modified StyleGAN2 architecture includes a mapping network for astrophysical parameters (\(\zeta\), \(T_{\text{vir}}\)) and a synthesis network with noise injection. Regularization techniques, such as \(r_1\) loss and path-length loss, ensure stability. Cross-domain correspondence (CDC) loss, calculated via cosine similarity and KL divergence, preserves diversity. Training involves two steps: initial small-scale training (40,000 iterations, four GPUs) and large-scale transfer learning (2,800 iterations, two GPUs). The discriminator uses ResNet blocks and a two-layer MLP to classify images. Test sets are sampled using Latin Hypercube Sampling, with parameters \((\log_{10} \zeta, \log_{10} T_{\text{vir}})\) covering five combinations.","The small-scale GAN achieves subpercent relative error in global \(T_b\) signals, <20\% error in 2D power spectrum (PS), and <10\% error in scattering transform (ST) coefficients. The large-scale GAN, trained via transfer learning, achieves <5\% error in \(T_b\) signals for most cases, <10\% PS error on small scales (\(k > 0.02 \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\)), and <20\% ST errors. Visual inspections confirm elimination of concatenating boundaries and accurate structural reproduction. Pixel-level and feature-level variance tests indicate minimal mode collapse, except for slight issues at large scales for \(\left(\log _{10} \zeta=2.05, \log _{10} T_{\text{vir}}=4.5\right)\). Computational costs are reduced by one to two orders of magnitude (11,400 vs. 150,000–900,000 CPU core hours).","The higher errors on very large scales (\(k \lesssim 0.02 \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\)) in the large-scale GAN are attributed to limited training data. The CDC loss effectively preserves diversity in generated images, as evidenced by variance tests. Transfer learning leverages small-scale simulations to capture small-scale features, while fine-tuning adapts the model to large-scale structures with minimal data. The computational savings arise from reusing pre-trained small-scale models, avoiding full retraining.","This multi-fidelity approach enables cost-effective emulation of high-fidelity 21 cm lightcone images, saving 90–99\% of computational resources. It is applicable to other astrophysical domains with correlated datasets, such as low- vs. high-resolution simulations or semi-numerical vs. full-numerical models. The method supports future large-scale surveys and opens avenues for exploring alternative generative models like normalizing flows or variational autoencoders."
2502.03782,Classification of Solar Radio Spectrum Based on Swin Transformer,Jian Chen et al.,"Solar radio observation is crucial for space weather early warning and solar physics research, particularly in real-time classification of solar radio spectrums to detect solar radio bursts. Traditional methods often involve convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are resource-intensive and have high parameter counts. The Swin transformer incorporates the benefits of CNNs, such as localization and translation invariance, while significantly improving classification accuracy and reducing computational resources.","The limitations of CNNs, including high computational demands and parameter counts, necessitate a more efficient approach. This paper introduces the Swin transformer combined with transfer learning to classify solar radio spectrums more efficiently. The method leverages pretrained model parameters, freezes the Swin transformer's hidden layer weights, and trains the fully connected layer on the target dataset, addressing the challenge of limited solar radio burst samples.","The dataset, sourced from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' solar broadband spectrometer (SBRS), includes 4408 solar radio spectrums categorized as burst, nonburst, and calibration. Preprocessing involves channel normalization to reduce noise from internal and external interference. The normalization adjusts pixel values using the formula:  
\[
\mathrm{g}(x, y)=f(x, y)-\frac{1}{n} \sum_{x=0}^{n} f(x, y)+\frac{1}{n m} \sum_{x=0}^{m} \sum_{y=0}^{n} f(x, y)
\]  
where \(m\) and \(n\) are pixel counts on the x and y axes. Grayscale images are converted to pseudocolor via bilinear interpolation, with target pixel \(g(x, y)\) calculated from neighboring pixels using:  
\[
g(x, y)=a+b+c+d
\]  
where  
\[
\begin{gathered}
a=(1-u)(1-v) f(i, j), \quad b=(1-u) v f(i, j+1), \\
c=u(1-v) f(i+1, j), \quad d=u v f(i+1, j+1).
\end{gathered}
\]  
The Swin transformer processes \(h \times w \times 3\) inputs into nonoverlapping \(4 \times 4\) patches, employing window-based self-attention (WMSA) to reduce computational complexity from \(O\left(n^{2}\right)\) to \(O(n)\). Transfer learning is applied by freezing the Swin transformer's hidden layer weights and training the fully connected layer on the target dataset.","The Swin transformer achieved a 100\% true positive rate (TPR) and 0\% false positive rate (FPR) across all categories (burst, nonburst, calibration). It reduced model parameters by 80\% (from 139,357,544 in VGG16 to 27,550,473) and training time significantly. Compared to the vision transformer, parameters decreased by 60\% (from 85,800,963 to 27,550,473). The model converged stably, with loss values reaching 0 by the third training round. It outperformed CGRU, CNN, multimodel, DBN, and PCA+SVM, achieving the highest TPR and lowest FPR.","The Swin transformer’s success is attributed to its self-attentive mechanism, which enhances global feature extraction and improves generalization. Its hierarchical structure, inspired by CNNs, allows gradual perceptual domain extension from local to global features. The integration of transfer learning mitigates data scarcity by leveraging pretrained parameters, while the reduced parameter count and computational complexity enhance efficiency.","This method advances the automatic processing of solar radio spectrums, enabling more effective space weather monitoring and solar physics research. Its reduced computational demands and high accuracy make it suitable for real-time applications. The approach provides a robust framework for astronomical image classification, demonstrating broader potential for analyzing complex datasets in astrophysics."
2502.03683,Ruling out AGNs as the dominant source of cosmic reionization with JWST,Danyang Jiang et al.,"The primary source of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons for cosmic reionization remains controversial due to insufficient constraints on contributions from galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While galaxies could produce sufficient LyC photons with an escape fraction \(f_{\text{esc}}\) exceeding 10-15\%, the average \(f_{\text{esc}}\) for lower-redshift galaxies is only a few percent. Direct detection of LyC emission from high-redshift objects is hindered by intergalactic medium (IGM) absorption. The UV luminosity function (LF) of luminous AGNs is well-established, but the faint end remains uncertain. Recent JWST discoveries of faint AGN candidates, including 'little-red-dots' (LRDs), suggest a potentially higher AGN spatial density at the faint end, raising the possibility of a significant AGN role in ionizing photon production.","The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has identified a high density of AGN candidates at high redshift, increasing the potential influence of AGNs on cosmic reionization. This study aims to establish a definitive upper bound on the AGN contribution to reionization, addressing the debate over whether AGNs could dominate the ionizing photon budget during the epoch of reionization (EoR).","Using JWST NIRCam data from the GOODS fields, a sample of 156 objects at \(7.15 \leq z \leq 7.75\) was constructed with high completeness. JWST image reduction utilized raw uncal.fits files processed via the JWST Calibration Pipeline (v.1.12.5), CEERS NIRCam imaging reduction scripts, and custom codes. Stage 1 corrected detector-level issues, Stage 2 applied flat-fielding and flux calibration, and Stage 3 created mosaics with \(0.03''\) pixel scale. Objects were decomposed into point-source (assumed AGNs) and extended components in rest-frame far-UV images using GalfitM, with a PSF constructed from stacked point sources and a Sérsic profile (\(n < 5\)) for extended components. The AGN UV LF was measured using \(M_{1450}\) magnitudes derived from F115W and F150W bands, with \(k\)-corrections from simulated quasar spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Completeness was estimated via photometric error simulations, and the LF was parametrized using a double power-law (DPL) with a fixed bright-end slope \(\beta = -2.78\).","The AGN UV LF yielded best-fit parameters \(\alpha=-1.70_{-0.25}^{+0.44}\) and \(M_{1450}^{*}=-17.81_{-1.35}^{+1.06}\) mag, with normalization \(\Phi^{*} = 10^{-3.7} \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \mathrm{mag}^{-1}\). The AGN LF is higher than extrapolated bright quasar LFs but lower than galaxy LFs. Assuming a 100\% escape fraction and a broken power-law SED (\(f_{v} \propto v^{-0.61}\) for \(\lambda>912 \AA\); \(f_{v} \propto v^{-1.70}\) for \(\lambda<912 \AA\)), AGNs contribute \(33_{-4}^{+6}\%\) of the required LyC photons for reionization, calculated as \(\dot{N}_{\text{ion}}(z)=10^{50.48}\left(\frac{C}{3}\right) \times\left(\frac{1+z}{7}\right)^{3} \mathrm{Mpc}^{-3} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\) (\(C=3\)). This upper bound rules out AGNs as the dominant ionizing source.","The 33\% AGN contribution represents an absolute upper limit due to conservative assumptions: (1) a 100\% escape fraction, likely overestimated for low-luminosity AGNs, and (2) attributing all point-source flux to AGNs, potentially inflating AGN flux from compact galaxy cores. The lack of a distinct LF 'knee' and large uncertainties in \(M_{1450}^{*}\) do not affect the ionizing photon calculation. These results confirm that galaxies dominate the ionizing photon budget during the EoR.","The study conclusively rules out AGNs as the primary drivers of cosmic reionization, implicating star-forming galaxies as the dominant ionizing source. Future JWST observations will refine faint AGN LF constraints and improve LyC escape fraction measurements, potentially solidifying this conclusion."
2502.03853,VERITAS and Multiwavelength Observations of Blazar B3 2247+381 in Response to an IceCube Neutrino Alert,Paudel et al.,"The IceCube Neutrino Observatory investigates extreme cosmic environments where ultra-high-energy cosmic rays are accelerated, aiming to resolve the long-standing question of their origins. Blazars—active galactic nuclei (AGN) with relativistic jets aligned toward Earth—are prime candidates for neutrino production due to their extreme energy outputs. IceCube’s Gamma-ray Follow-Up (GFU) program monitors gamma-ray sources for neutrino clusters, generating alerts for potential astrophysical neutrino sources. The BL Lac object B3 2247+381, initially detected in very high-energy (VHE) gamma rays by MAGIC, exhibited a soft spectrum consistent with a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model.","A 2022 IceCube GFU alert triggered by a muon neutrino event cluster (3.2σ significance over 174 days) prompted multiwavelength observations of B3 2247+381. The study aimed to determine whether this blazar could be a source of astrophysical neutrinos by correlating neutrino events with electromagnetic emissions, particularly during flaring states.","VERITAS conducted gamma-ray observations (85 GeV–30 TeV) using imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, applying quality cuts and background estimation via ""wobble"" mode. Fermi-LAT analyzed GeV gamma rays (100 MeV–300 GeV) using PASS 8 IRFs and binned likelihood methods. NuSTAR observed hard X-rays (3–79 keV), Swift-XRT/UVOT covered soft X-rays and optical-UV bands, and optical monitoring utilized ASAS-SN, ATLAS, and FLWO telescopes. Spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling employed a Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) method with a one-zone SSC model, incorporating parameters like Doppler factor (\(\delta\)), magnetic field (\(B\)), and electron energy distribution.","VERITAS detected no significant gamma-ray emission (0.88σ excess; 99% flux upper limit of \(3.6 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{~cm}^{-2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\) above 200 GeV). Fermi-LAT observed no emission during the alert period but detected a 23σ signal in archival data. NuSTAR identified hard X-ray emission (42σ significance; flux \((1.45 \pm 0.05) \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{erg~cm}^{-2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\)). Optical-UV data showed no variability. The SED fit a one-zone SSC model (\(\chi_{\text{red}}^2=1.14\)), with parameters consistent with prior MAGIC observations. Hadronic scenarios requiring proton energies beyond PeV scales were disfavored by VERITAS upper limits and low GeV fluxes.","The absence of flaring activity across wavelengths during the IceCube alert suggests B3 2247+381 was in a quiescent state. The SSC model adequately explains the SED without requiring hadronic processes, which would necessitate unobserved photon fluxes. The neutrino alert is likely a background fluctuation rather than a genuine astrophysical signal.","This study highlights challenges in associating neutrino alerts with blazar activity, emphasizing the need for improved neutrino localization and multiwavelength follow-ups. Future detectors like IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT will enhance sensitivity to constrain cosmic-ray origins. The results underscore the importance of SED modeling and temporal variability analysis in identifying neutrino sources."
2502.04300,CMB-S4: Foreground-Cleaning Pipeline Comparison for Measuring Primordial Gravitational Waves,Federico Bianchini et al. (CMB-S4 Collaboration),"The cosmic microwave background (CMB) provides critical insights into the early Universe, particularly through \(B\)-mode polarization, which may reveal primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) generated during inflation. The tensor-to-scalar ratio \(r\) quantifies the amplitude of PGWs, distinguishing between inflationary models and probing energy scales beyond particle physics. Experiments like CMB-S4 aim to constrain \(r \leq 0.001\) or detect \(r \geq 0.003\) at \(5 \sigma\), testing models such as Starobinsky and Higgs inflation. Key challenges include isolating faint PGW signals from lensing-induced \(B\)-modes and Galactic foregrounds. Recent advances in component-separation methods, ranging from parametric to non-parametric approaches, have improved foreground mitigation, necessitating comparative evaluations under realistic observing conditions.","This study evaluates three foreground-cleaning pipelines for CMB-S4 to ensure robust inference of \(r\). The motivation arises from the need to validate methods against increasingly complex Galactic foregrounds and instrumental noise, which can introduce biases or inflate uncertainties. By testing parametric (model-based) and non-parametric (e.g., internal linear combination) approaches across simulated foreground suites, the work identifies pipeline-specific strengths and limitations. The goal is to inform strategies for achieving CMB-S4’s sensitivity targets while minimizing systematic errors from residual foreground contamination.","Three pipelines are compared: (A) a parametric cross-spectrum method fitting auto- and cross-power spectra of multi-frequency maps; (B) a harmonic-space internal linear combination (ILC) approach assuming statistical independence between CMB and contaminants; and (C) a parametric map-based method estimating spectral parameters via likelihood and reconstructing components with least-squares. Simulations combine lensed CMB, Galactic dust/synchrotron (with three complexity levels: Gaussian, isotropic, and non-Gaussian), and instrumental noise. Delensing is implemented iteratively using a lensing template derived from \(E\)-mode maps, achieving 92% efficiency. Foreground models include spatially varying spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and frequency decorrelation. Power spectra are computed using pseudo-\(C_{\ell}\) estimators, with likelihoods approximated via the Hamimeche-Lewis framework. Noise properties follow CMB-S4 Small Aperture Telescope specifications, incorporating \(1/f\) noise and hit-map scaling.","For simple foregrounds (Model 0), all pipelines yield unbiased \(r\) estimates with \(\sigma(r) \simeq 3 \times 10^{-4}\). Intermediate complexity (Model 1) slightly increases \(\sigma(r)\) by 13%, while highly non-Gaussian foregrounds (Model 2) introduce \(1.6-1.9 \sigma\) biases. Marginalizing over residuals reduces biases to \(\lesssim 0.1 \sigma\) but inflates \(\sigma(r)\) by 29–100%. For \(r=0.003\), \(\sigma(r)\) ranges \(5.2-5.8 \times 10^{-4}\), corresponding to \(5 \sigma\) detections in simple cases. Complex foregrounds reduce detection significances to \(2-4 \sigma\), with Pipeline C’s significance dropping to \(1.8 \sigma\) due to inflexible dust modeling. Delensing reduces \(\sigma(r)\) by factors of 10 (\(r=0\)) and 6 (\(r=0.003\)). PySM models confirm Pipeline A’s robustness, while Pipelines B and C exhibit biases in high-complexity scenarios. Cross-pipeline correlations decrease with foreground complexity, reflecting method-dependent sensitivities.","The superior stability of Pipeline A stems from its parametric cross-spectrum approach, which explicitly models foreground spectra and leverages multi-frequency cross-correlations. Pipelines B and C, while effective for simple foregrounds, struggle with spatially varying SEDs due to ILC’s isotropic weighting (B) and fixed spectral indices (C). Residual biases in complex cases highlight the limitations of assuming uniform foreground properties. Delensing significantly reduces sample variance but requires precise template noise modeling. The trade-off between bias mitigation and uncertainty inflation underscores the need for adaptable residual marginalization strategies.","The results emphasize the necessity of cross-validating pipelines to ensure reliable \(r\) measurements in CMB-S4. Pipeline A’s robustness advocates for its adoption as a baseline, while Pipelines B and C require enhancements in handling SED variability. Future work must address anisotropic noise, systematics, and Chilean site challenges, leveraging lessons from South Pole simulations. Achieving \(\sigma(r) \sim 10^{-4}\) demands hybrid methods combining parametric and non-parametric techniques, rigorous delensing, and multi-frequency coverage to mitigate foreground residuals. This study establishes a framework for optimizing component-separation strategies in next-generation CMB experiments."

Boruah et al.,"Weak gravitational lensing probes the underlying matter distribution by distorting galaxy shapes, with the shear field \(\gamma\) linked to the convergence field \(\kappa\). The convergence is expressed as \(\kappa(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \int_{0}^{\chi_{\mathrm{H}}} d\chi g(\chi)\delta(\chi\boldsymbol{\theta}, \chi)\), where \(g(\chi)\) is the lensing efficiency. Traditional mass mapping methods, such as Kaiser-Squires (KS) inversion and Wiener filtering, rely on Gaussian priors, which are insufficient for late-time convergence fields due to gravitational nonlinearity. Log-normal priors and Generative Point Transformed Gaussian (GPTG) transforms offer improvements but remain limited. Generative models like GANs and normalizing flows have been explored, but diffusion models present a promising alternative for learning convergence field distributions.","Stage IV cosmological surveys (Euclid, LSST, Roman Space Telescope) require advanced methods to analyze high-quality weak lensing data. Traditional 2-point statistics miss non-Gaussian cosmological information, necessitating field-level inference (FLI) and deep learning approaches. Fast, accurate generative models are critical for applications like cluster detection, covariance estimation, and extracting non-Gaussian features. Current methods face scalability and bias challenges, motivating the development of diffusion-based frameworks to address these limitations.","A diffusion model is developed for simulating weak lensing maps and reconstructing mass maps via Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). The forward stochastic differential equation (SDE) \(\mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{x}=f(\boldsymbol{x}, t) \mathrm{d} t+g(t) \mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{w}\) adds noise to convergence maps, while the reverse process \(\mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{x}=\left[f(\boldsymbol{x}, t)-g^{2}(t) \nabla_{\boldsymbol{x}} \log p_{t}(\boldsymbol{x})\right] \mathrm{d} t+g(t) \mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{w}\) denoises using a score network \(\boldsymbol{s}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x}, t)\). The model is trained on convergence maps from the MassiveNuS simulation suite at redshifts \(z=0.5, 1.0, 1.5\), regridded to \(256 \times 256\) pixels. Noisy mock shear data with LSST-Y10-like shape noise are generated for posterior sampling. To mitigate bias in standard DPS, the likelihood term is down-weighted at early sampling steps using \(A(t)=\operatorname{Sigmoid}\left[\frac{\bar{t}-t}{\sigma_{t}}\right]\) with \(\bar{t}=500\) and \(\sigma_{t}=20\). A UNet with 35 million parameters approximates the score function, trained via loss \(L(\boldsymbol{\theta})=\mathbb{E}\left[\left\|\boldsymbol{\epsilon}-\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t}} \boldsymbol{x}_{0}+\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_{t} \boldsymbol{\epsilon}}, t\right)\right\|^{2}\right]\).","The diffusion model generates convergence maps with \(<1\%\) power spectrum bias and accurate non-Gaussian statistics, validated via scattering transforms \(S_1(j_1) = \langle|\kappa * \psi(j_1)|\rangle\) and \(S_2(j_1, j_2) = \langle||\kappa * \psi(j_1)| * \psi(j_2)|\rangle\). Posterior sampling reconstructs mass maps with \(\sim 50\%\) improvement in RMSE and Pearson correlation \(\rho_{c}\) over KS inversion, particularly at low redshifts. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) contours detect peaks and voids, while pixel-wise uncertainty quantification reveals spatially correlated errors. The model reproduces covariance matrices for cosmological inference and outperforms Gaussian/lognormal prior-based methods in small-scale fidelity.","The diffusion model captures the joint distribution of non-Gaussian statistics, enabling accurate covariance estimation and unbiased mass map reconstruction. Down-weighting the likelihood term in DPS reduces early-time sampling bias, validated by alignment of posterior maps (via 1-point PDF, peak counts, and void counts) with true convergence fields. The method’s scalability and computational efficiency (\(\mathcal{O}(50\) seconds per sample on a V100 GPU) address limitations of traditional Bayesian and machine learning approaches, which struggle with multimodal posteriors and high-resolution data.","The framework streamlines weak lensing analysis by unifying simulation generation and inverse problem solving. It enables rapid production of simulation-quality maps (\(\mathcal{O}(10\) seconds on GPU), aiding covariance estimation and large-scale structure studies. Applications include detecting filaments, voids, and clusters from noisy data, enhancing signal-to-noise for less massive structures. Future extensions could integrate the model into field-level cosmological inference, improving constraints on parameters like \(S_8\) and \(\Omega_m\). The method’s open-source implementation facilitates adoption in upcoming surveys, advancing non-Gaussian cosmology research."
2502.03861,Analysis of Newly Catalogued Open Star Cluster UPK 220 with Gaia DR3 and TESS: Discovering Member Variable Stars,İncí Akkaya Oralhan et al.,"Open clusters (OCs) are gravitationally bound stellar populations crucial for studying star formation, stellar evolution, and Galactic dynamics. They are classified by age into young (\(<10^6\) yr), intermediate-age (\(10^6-10^7\) yr), and old (\(>10^7\) yr), providing insights into coeval stellar systems. The Gaia mission, particularly Gaia DR3, has significantly expanded the census of OCs, enabling precise determinations of their fundamental parameters (distance, age, metallicity, reddening) and identification of variable stars.","This study focuses on the intermediate-age OC UPK 220 to leverage Gaia DR3 for membership analysis and TESS photometry to detect variable stars. By integrating these datasets, the research aims to constrain cluster and stellar parameters, enhancing understanding of stellar evolution and Galactic structure through the characterization of variable stars and their properties.","The study employs Gaia DR3 and TESS data for membership analysis and variability detection in UPK 220. The pyUPMASK algorithm, utilizing Gaia DR3 parameters (\(\mu_{\alpha}\), \(\mu_{\delta}\), \(\varpi\), and photometric bands), distinguishes 163 cluster members from field stars within a 30-arcmin radius. A King profile fit to the radial density profile yields core radius \(R_c=5.751 \pm 1.079\) arcmin and cluster limit radius \(R_{\mathrm{lim}}=24.0\) arcmin. TESS data spanning 124.29 days across five sectors are analyzed using lightkurve and TESScut to extract light curves, identifying eight variable stars. Variability classification is based on periodograms and light curve shapes, with eclipsing binaries modeled using JKTEBOP. Stellar atmospheric parameters (\(T_{\text{eff}}\), \(\log g\), \([Fe/H]\)) are derived using GSP-Phot, GSP-Spec, and SED fitting via the ARIADNE package. The MESA code and Metalcode tool are used to model variable stars and iteratively refine metallicity, age, and reddening through isochrone fitting.","The median parallax and proper motion values for UPK 220 are \(\varpi=1.03 \pm 0.03\) mas and \(\left(\mu_{\alpha}, \mu_{\delta}\right)=(-2.41 \pm 0.11,-2.64 \pm 0.12)\) mas/yr. Eight variable stars are identified: three eclipsing binaries (IDs 29, 67, 116), two pulsating (IDs 49, 138), two magnetic active (IDs 16, 42), and one rotating (ID 147). The best-fit cluster parameters include \(d=832\) pc, \(E(G_{BP}-G_{RP})=1.10\) mag, \(t=200\) Myr, and \(Z=0.005\), with Gaia DR3 \([Fe/H]=-0.57\). MIST isochrone fitting yields \([Fe/H]=-0.56\), \(DM_0=9.6\) mag, and age \(140\) Myr. TESS light curves reveal variability patterns, with eclipsing binaries showing orbital parameters and pulsating stars exhibiting periods from 0.6663 to 2.857 days. Spectral properties from GSP-Phot, SED, and MESA models indicate \(T_{\text{eff}}\) ranges of 4600–11481 K for binaries and 4419–8577 K for single stars, with masses between 0.6 \(M_{\odot}\) and 3.2 \(M_{\odot}\).","Stars with membership probabilities \(P \geq 0.725\) confirm UPK 220’s mean proper motions and structural parameters (\(R_c=5.751 \pm 1.079\) arcmin, \(R_{\mathrm{lim}}=24.0\) arcmin), aligning with prior studies. Discrepancies in age, metallicity, and reddening with literature values arise from differing isochrones and photometric data. Variable stars near the main sequence (MS) or binary sequence (BS) suggest a coeval population, while deviations in IDs 16 and 29 imply potential membership uncertainties or an older cluster age. Binary systems influence cluster dynamics, with mass segregation and energy regulation effects. Metallicity discrepancies (\([Fe/H]=-0.56\) vs. solar) affect distance modulus calculations, highlighting the sensitivity of parameter determinations to input assumptions.","This study provides the first metallicity determination for UPK 220, establishing a benchmark for future analyses. The identification of eight variable stars, including T-Tauri candidates and pulsating variables, enhances understanding of pre-main-sequence evolution and stellar activity in intermediate-age clusters. Discrepancies in derived parameters underscore the impact of methodological choices (e.g., isochrone models, photometric bands) on cluster characterization. The results emphasize the need for spectral observations to confirm binary components and accretion disks, particularly for outliers like IDs 29 and 67. These findings contribute to broader insights into stellar evolution, binary interactions, and Galactic dynamics through the lens of open cluster studies."
2502.04169,The Effects of Kinematic MHD on the Atmospheric Circulation of Eccentric Hot Jupiters,Hayley Beltz et al.,"Hot Jupiters (HJs) are massive planets with short orbital periods, typically on circular, tidally synchronized orbits, leading to permanent daysides and nightsides. Atmospheric models, particularly 3D general circulation models (GCMs), predict a broad superrotating equatorial jet driven by temperature contrasts, shifting the hottest point eastward of the substellar point. Eccentric HJs, such as HD 80606b and HAT-P-2b, experience time-varying stellar irradiation, disrupting synchronous rotation and atmospheric circulation. Previous studies by Kataria et al. (2013) and Lewis et al. (2014) show that eccentricity narrows and strengthens the equatorial jet, induces mid-latitude westward winds, and increases day-night temperature contrasts. Magnetic drag, significant above \(\sim 1500 \mathrm{~K}\), shapes atmospheric dynamics, with non-ideal MHD models revealing time-varying hotspot offsets.","This study is the first to couple a GCM with a temperature-dependent magnetic drag prescription for eccentric HJs, addressing the limitations of uniform drag approximations. The work explores the impact of eccentricity and magnetic fields on atmospheric circulation, thermal structure, and emission spectra, providing a comprehensive understanding of eccentric HJ atmospheres.","The study employs the 3D RM-GCM, solving primitive equations for atmospheric circulation, coupled with an updated picket fence radiative transfer scheme modeling opacities in five bands. The RM-GCM incorporates kinematic MHD via a temperature-dependent magnetic drag timescale \(\tau_{\text{mag}}\), derived from non-ideal MHD equations and applied as Rayleigh drag in the momentum equation. The model assumes a dipole magnetic field aligned with the planet’s rotation axis, limiting drag to the east-west direction. Five simulations of eccentric TOI-150b (\(e=0.26\)) with varying magnetic field strengths (0G, 3G, 10G, 30G) and one circular model were run for 1000 orbits. Post-processing generates high-resolution (\(R=100,000\)) and low-resolution (\(R=150\)) emission spectra, focusing on CO as a tracer molecule. Chemical equilibrium and solar abundances are assumed, with opacities sourced from the ExoMol database. Cloud modeling uses EGP+, a 1D radiative-convective model, with three cloud cases varying particle size and vertical extent via sedimentation efficiency \(f_{\text{sed}}=3,1,0.5\), alongside a cloud-free scenario.","Eccentricity induces high-latitude westward winds, narrows the equatorial jet, and causes phase-dependent thermal inversions, with inversions strongest near periastron. Magnetic drag alters circulation, with stronger fields (10G, 30G) weakening the equatorial jet and extending westward winds to mid-latitudes. Magnetic drag amplifies temperature inversions near periastron, as radiative timescales \(\tau_{rad} = \frac{P}{g} \frac{c_p}{4 \sigma T^3}\) dominate over advective timescales \(\tau_{adv} = \frac{R}{U}\). Phase curves show peak flux occurring slightly before periastron, with magnetic drag delaying peak amplitude. High-resolution spectra reveal increased flux near periastron and reduced Doppler broadening with stronger fields, particularly in the 10G and 30G cases. Clouds slightly warm the upper atmosphere near apastron but dissipate near periastron, with TiO inducing thermal inversions near periastron. Low-resolution spectra highlight stronger CO\(_2\) absorption in 3D models due to steeper temperature gradients.","The results confirm that eccentricity and magnetic drag induce temporal variability in atmospheric dynamics, consistent with Kataria et al. (2013) and Mayorga et al. (2021). Magnetic drag weakens zonal winds and enhances meridional flows, altering temperature structures and Doppler shifts. The 10G model exhibits the largest wind variability, indicating phase-dependent atmospheric responses. Assumptions such as a dipole magnetic field, solar metallicity, and pseudo-synchronous rotation limit the model’s generality. Future JWST observations could validate 3D effects, particularly CO\(_2\) and H\(_2\)O features, while advanced radiative transfer and complex magnetic field models could refine predictions.","Eccentric HJs offer a unique testbed for studying atmospheric dynamics over short timescales. JWST spectra could confirm temperature inversions and differentiate between magnetic models. Phase curves and secondary eclipse observations may reveal day-night contrasts and hotspot offsets, constraining orbital dynamics. The interplay between eccentricity, magnetic fields, and radiative forcing underscores the need for temperature-dependent drag prescriptions in atmospheric models. High-resolution spectroscopy can probe inter-orbit variability, with reduced Doppler shifts in magnetically active cases (e.g., 30G shows \(0.25 \mathrm{~km/s}\) blueshift), providing observational benchmarks for future studies."
2502.03929,pyEFPE: An improved post-Newtonian waveform model for inspiralling precessing-eccentric compact binaries,Gonzalo Morras et al.,"Spin-precession and orbital eccentricity in gravitational-wave (GW) signals are crucial for understanding compact binary formation and evolution. At Newtonian order, an eccentric binary orbit is described by Keplerian parametrization: \(r(u) = a(1 - e \cos u)\), \(\phi_N = v(u) = 2 \arctan\left[\left(\frac{1+e}{1-e}\right)^{1/2} \tan \frac{u}{2}\right]\), and \(\ell = u - e \sin u\), where \(a\), \(e\), and \(u\) are the semi-major axis, eccentricity, and eccentric anomaly, respectively. Post-Newtonian (PN) effects introduce periastron advance \(k\), modifying the orbital phase \(\phi = (1+k)v \approx (1+k)\ell + (v - \ell)\). The GW polarizations \(h_{+, \times}\) are decomposed using spin-weighted spherical harmonics, with spin-induced precession complicating the GW modes. Transforming to a co-precessing frame simplifies the analysis, where inertial frame polarizations are reconstructed using Wigner \(D\)-matrices and Euler angles.","Accurate modeling of spin-precession and eccentricity remains challenging. PyEFPE addresses this by improving numerical stability, introducing analytical expressions for Fourier mode amplitudes, and incorporating recent PN corrections. It aims to provide a flexible framework for future enhancements while achieving computational efficiency for GW data analysis.","The waveform model employs Newtonian Fourier mode amplitudes for dominant \(l=2, m=\{0, \pm 2\}\) modes, derived using Bessel functions to simplify nested sums. Fourier mode selection optimizes efficiency by including minimal modes to meet tolerance \(\epsilon_N\). Spin precession in eccentric orbits is modeled via multiple scale analysis (MSA), separating radiation reaction (RR) and spin precession timescales. The precession equations, including leading PN spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions, are solved analytically using Jacobi elliptic functions. Radiation reaction effects are incorporated through PN parameter \(y\) and eccentricity \(e\) evolution equations:  
\[
\mathcal{D} y = \nu y^{9}\left(a_{0}+\sum_{n=2}^{6} a_{n} y^{n}\right), \quad \mathcal{D} e^{2} = -\nu y^{8}\left(b_{0}+\sum_{n=2}^{6} b_{n} y^{n}\right).
\]  
Initial conditions are set using astrophysical parameters (masses, spins, eccentricity) and converted to model variables. The Fourier transform for frequency-domain waveforms uses the Shifted Uniform Asymptotics (SUA) method, correcting amplitude time-dependence. Amplitude interpolation reduces computational cost via Chebyshev polynomials and cubic splines.","PyEFPE achieves a computational speedup of \(\sim \mathcal{O}(20)\) compared to time-domain models. Validation against SpinTaylorT4 and TaylorF2 shows mismatches \(\lesssim 10^{-3}\) for aligned-spin cases, increasing to \(\lesssim 10^{-1}\) for precessing systems with higher PN corrections. Comparisons with TaylorF2Ecc reveal growing mismatches with eccentricity, highlighting PyEFPE’s advantage for large \(e\). Parameter estimation tests recover injected values (e.g., \(e_0=0.2\), \(\chi_p\)) with posteriors consistent with true parameters. Amplitude interpolation reduces waveform evaluation time to \(\sim 0.1\)s for \(T \leq 32\)s, enabling feasible Bayesian inference.","The model’s accuracy is sufficient for current detectors, though higher PN terms are needed for future observatories like LISA. Eccentricity and precession effects decouple in low-mass systems, enabling independent measurement via orbital phase \(\lambda\) and periastron advance \(\delta \lambda\). Mismatches with IMRPhenomXP emphasize the need for higher-order spin corrections. Computational efficiency is driven by analytical precession solutions and amplitude interpolation, critical for long-duration signals.","PyEFPE provides a publicly available tool (https://github.com/gmorras/pyEFPE) for Bayesian inference and real-data analysis. Future work will incorporate higher-order modes, tidal effects, and merger-ringdown phases. The model advances GW astronomy by enabling detailed studies of binary formation channels and spin-eccentricity correlations."
2502.04283,The Young Ages of \(70 \mu \mathrm{~m}\)-Dark Clumps,Kadin Worthen et al.,"High-mass star formation (HMSF) initial conditions remain poorly understood, particularly in cold, dense molecular clouds. \(70 \mu \mathrm{m}\)-dark clumps (SMDCs) are quiescent, dense (\(n(\mathrm{H}_{2}) \approx 10^{3}-10^{5} \mathrm{cm}^{-3}\)), and cold (\(T < 20 \mathrm{K}\)), lacking embedded protostars. These properties make SMDCs ideal probes of HMSF's early stages. Carbon chain molecules like \(\mathrm{HC}_{5} \mathrm{N}\), \(\mathrm{HC}_{7} \mathrm{N}\), and CCS are potential tracers of early chemical evolution, as their abundances diminish over time due to ion reactions and dust depletion.","This study aims to determine whether SMDCs are young and capable of HMSF or merely inefficient at forming stars. By observing carbon chain chemistry in SMDCs, the authors seek to establish their chemical ages and assess their potential to form high-mass stars. The utility of carbon chains as independent probes of clump youth is a key motivator, addressing uncertainties in distinguishing between young and inefficient clumps.","The Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in D configuration observed 12 SMDCs in the K-band (18–26.5 GHz), targeting \(\mathrm{HC}_{5} \mathrm{N}\), CCS, and \(\mathrm{HC}_{7} \mathrm{N}\). Spectral resolutions ranged from \(0.16\) to \(0.42 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\), with a synthesized beam of \(\theta_{\text{syn}} \approx 33^{\prime\prime} 4\). \(\mathrm{NH}_{3}(1,1)\) moment 0 and 1 maps guided spectral extraction via masking and velocity registration to enhance SNR. Column densities were calculated assuming LTE and optically thin lines, using rotational partition functions and excitation temperatures (\(4-6 \mathrm{K}\)). Gas masses and \(\mathrm{H}_{2}\) column densities were derived from ATLASGAL \(870 \mu \mathrm{m}\) data. UMIST dark cloud chemistry models simulated carbon chain evolution at \(n(\mathrm{H}_{2}) = 2 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{cm}^{-3}\) and \(T_{k} = 12 \mathrm{K}\).","\(\mathrm{HC}_{5} \mathrm{N}\) and CCS were detected in 11 of 12 sources; \(\mathrm{HC}_{7} \mathrm{N}\) was identified via spectral stacking. Column densities for \(\mathrm{HC}_{5} \mathrm{N}\) and CCS showed a positive correlation (\(r = 0.70\)), while \(\mathrm{HC}_{5} \mathrm{N}\) abundances aligned with UMIST models, suggesting chemical ages \(<0.5 \mathrm{Myr}\). \(\mathrm{HC}_{5} \mathrm{N}/\mathrm{HC}_{7} \mathrm{N}\) ratios indicated ages \(<1 \mathrm{Myr\). Clump densities (\(n(\mathrm{H}_{2}) \approx 2 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{cm}^{-3}\)) and masses (\(>400 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\)) meet HMSF criteria. Virial parameters (\(\alpha \sim 0.7\)) confirmed gravitational binding. CCS abundances exceeded UMIST predictions by an order of magnitude, attributed to uncertain destruction rates.","The young chemical ages (\(<1 \mathrm{Myr}\)) derived from carbon chains suggest SMDCs are in early HMSF stages rather than being inefficient. Key reactions like \(\mathrm{N}+\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{HC}_{5} \mathrm{N}+\mathrm{H}\) dominate cyanopolyyne production, while \(\mathrm{C}^{+}\)-mediated destruction limits their lifetimes. Warm Carbon Chain Chemistry (WCCC) and outflow-driven processes are ruled out due to low temperatures (\(T < 25 \mathrm{K}\)) and narrow line widths. The alignment of free-fall timescales (\(t_{\mathrm{ff}} \approx 4.4 \times 10^{5}\) years) with chemical ages supports dynamical youth. Low-mass Class 0 protostars in 10 clumps indicate localized collapse, while the clumps remain globally unevolved.","SMDCs represent pristine environments for studying HMSF initial conditions, with carbon chains serving as robust youth indicators. Their high masses, densities, and gravitational binding confirm HMSF potential. The statistical improbability (\(3 \times 10^{-15}\)) of all clumps being inefficient underscores their capacity for future high-mass star formation. This work establishes carbon chain chemistry as a critical tool for probing early chemical evolution, with implications for understanding cloud collapse timescales and the role of turbulence and magnetic fields in delaying star formation."
2502.03704,Electron-induced \(\mathrm{CO}\),Sankhabrata Chandra et al.,"The origin of \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) on Europa, detected in its exosphere and surface chaos regions, remains uncertain, with debates centering on whether it forms via radiolysis or originates from subsurface ocean upwelling. \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) is prevalent across icy bodies like Europa, Ganymede, and Enceladus, but its endogenic versus exogenic origin is unresolved. Recent studies suggest Europa’s \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) is endogenic, linked to young chaos terrains. Radiolysis of complex organic molecules (COMs), including hydrocarbons, alcohols, and carboxylic acids—detected throughout the Solar System—may generate \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) and influence surface and exospheric compositions.","This study investigates the radiolysis pathway by examining how functional groups in COMs affect electron-induced sputtering behavior, particularly \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) production, at temperatures (80–120 K) relevant to icy bodies like Europa, Titan, and Enceladus. The goal is to determine whether carboxylic acid groups enhance volatile species ejection, providing insights into the potential sources of \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) detected on Europa.","Electron sputtering experiments were conducted at JPL’s Ice Spectroscopy Laboratory using a vacuum chamber (<10\(^{-8}\) mbar) equipped with an electron gun and quadrupole mass spectrometer. Ice samples (\(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\):hexanoic acid, \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\):hexanol, \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\):hexane) were prepared via vapor or spray deposition onto a copper substrate cooled by a closed-cycle helium cryostat (80 K, 100 K, 120 K). A 2 keV electron beam (5 µA current, 120-minute irradiation) delivered an energy flux of \(1.1 \times 10^{13}\) keV cm\(^{-2}\) s\(^{-1}\), simulating ~360 hours of radiation exposure on Europa. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments identified released species.","Hexanoic acid ice produced 78% more \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) than pure water ice at 100 K, while hexanol ice yielded 24% more. Acid-functionalized molecules generated over 10x more \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) than non- or alcohol-functionalized ones, with yields peaking at 100–120 K. Hydrocarbon fragments (\(\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{z}=15\), likely \(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\)) showed higher intensities in acid-functionalized ices. Pentane (\(\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{z}=72\)) sputtering was ~100x higher in \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\):hexanoic acid than in \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\):hexanol at 120 K. TPD revealed that 36% of \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) was sputtered at 80 K for hexanoic acid, compared to 97% at 120 K. Hexanoic acid ice released pentane and \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) via \(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{COOH}\) cleavage, while hexanol ice produced less-volatile hexane via \(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{OH}\) cleavage.","Carboxylic acid groups facilitate \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) production through simple bond cleavage, whereas alcohols require oxidation, which may lose volatile intermediates. Temperature-dependent volatility determines whether species are ejected into the exosphere or retained on the surface. Acids generate shorter carbon chains and more \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\), leaving hydrocarbon residues. Fatty acids, if present, may sputter \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) and hydrocarbons, but their detectability as biosignatures diminishes once the carboxylic group is lost.","The functional group composition and surface temperature of icy bodies critically influence their exosphere and surface chemistry. Carboxylic acids enhance \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) and hydrocarbon ejection, potentially explaining Europa’s \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\)-rich chaos regions. These findings underscore the role of radiation-induced bond cleavage and volatility in shaping the observable chemistry of icy moons, with implications for future missions targeting biosignature detection."
2502.04059,Fundamental Oscillations of Massive Boson Stars and Distinguishability,"L.S. et al. \({ }^{1}\) Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Post Bag 4, Ganeshkhind, Pune University Campus, Pune - 411007, India; \({ }^{2}\) Institut für Theoretische Physik, Goethe Universität, Max-von-Laue-Straße 1, 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany","Dark matter (DM) constitutes approximately 25\% of the universe's energy budget, yet its particle nature remains unknown. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) have been traditional DM candidates, but experimental searches have not confirmed them. Scalar particles like axions and fuzzy DM have emerged as alternative bosonic DM candidates. Boson stars (BSs), self-gravitating configurations of bosonic particles, are exotic compact objects (ECOs) that could mimic black holes (BHs) or neutron stars (NSs). Gravitational wave (GW) detection offers a novel method to probe non-accreting BSs.","The discovery of the Higgs boson and predictions of scalar particles have shifted focus to light bosonic DM. If BSs exist, they could contribute significantly to the DM budget and transform our understanding of compact objects. Distinguishing BSs from BHs and NSs through GW observations of \(f\)-mode oscillations provides a critical opportunity to explore DM parameter space and validate bosonic DM models.","Massive BSs are modeled using a self-interacting scalar field with potential \(V(\phi)=\frac{1}{2} m^{2}|\phi|^{2}+\frac{1}{4} \lambda|\phi|^{4}\), where \(m\) is the particle mass and \(\lambda\) is the self-interaction parameter. In the strong-interaction limit (\(\Lambda \equiv \frac{\lambda M_{Pl}^{2}}{4 \pi m^{2}} \gg 1\)), BSs resemble fermionic stars, with mass scaling as \(M_{\max} \propto \sqrt{\lambda} M_{Pl}^{3} / m^{2}\). The effective equation of state is \(p=\frac{m^{4}}{9 \lambda}\left(\sqrt{1+\frac{3 \lambda}{m^{4}}} \rho-1\right)^{2}\). Scaling relations for \(f\)-mode oscillations are derived using full general relativity, incorporating metric perturbations and the Zerilli equation. The Cowling approximation demonstrates scaling invariance, with perturbation functions \(W(r)\) and \(V(r)\) obeying boundary conditions for vanishing pressure at the surface.","The scaled \(f\)-mode frequency \(f^{\prime}=f(x M_{Pl})\) and damping time \(\tau^{\prime}=\tau/(x M_{Pl})\) are universal across the DM parameter space, with \(f_{\max}^{\prime}=0.21\) and \(\tau_{\min}^{\prime}=1900\) for maximum compactness (\(C=0.16\)). The minimum number of oscillations is \(N_{\min}=406\). BS \(f\)-mode frequencies scale as \(f_{BS} = 202.67 f^{\prime}(C) M^{\prime}(C) \left(\frac{M_{\odot}}{M_{BS}}\right) \mathrm{kHz}\), yielding \(f_{BS, \max} = 2.67 \left(\frac{M_{\odot}}{M_{BS}}\right) \mathrm{kHz}\). BSs partially overlap with NSs in the \(f-M\) space but exhibit distinct ratios: \(\mathcal{R}_{BS/BH} = 0.22\) and \(\frac{f_{BS}}{f_{BS}^{ISCO}} = 6.79\) for maximum compactness. BH \(f\)-modes are consistently higher by a factor of 4.5.","The universal scaling relations enable \(f\)-mode calculations for any \((\lambda, m)\) without separate studies. BSs with \(C=0.16\) are distinguishable from BHs via the fixed frequency ratio \(\mathcal{R}_{BS/BH}\), while their higher \(f\)-mode-to-ISCO frequency ratio reduces dynamical tide effects in binaries. Overlap with NSs in mass but divergence in frequency bands allows GW observations to identify BSs.","These results provide a unified framework to explore the DM parameter space and distinguish BSs from BHs and NSs through GW detections. The scaling relations eliminate the need for redundant studies across parameter values, streamlining future research. This work opens avenues to detect \(f\)-modes, extend analyses to spinning BSs, and investigate higher compactness via \(\phi^n\) potentials (\(n>4\)), advancing the search for bosonic DM and ECOs."

In this regime, the system behaves like a perfect fluid with an effective equation of state \(p^{\prime}=\frac{1}{9}(\sqrt{1+3\rho^{\prime}}-1)^{2}\). The parameter space for scalar DM forming massive BSs spans \(10^{-25} \mathrm{eV}<m<100 \mathrm{GeV}\) and \(\lambda \leq 15\), with constraints from CMB/LSS data, dwarf galaxies, and self-interaction cross-sections.","The study aims to analyze the fundamental non-radial oscillations (\(f\)-modes) of massive BSs and their gravitational wave (GW) emission, which had not been previously explored. The goal is to derive scaling relations for \(f\)-mode characteristics, establish universal relations for BSs, and identify the detectable parameter space for current and next-generation GW detectors like LISA, LIGO, and NEMO.","The scalar DM model employs a quartic self-interaction potential \(V(|\phi|)=\frac{1}{2} m^{2}|\phi|^{2}+\frac{1}{4} \lambda|\phi|^{4}\). In the strong-interaction limit (\(\Lambda>1000\)), BS properties are scaled as \(f=f^{\prime}/(x M_{Pl})\) and \(\tau=\tau^{\prime}(x M_{Pl})\), where \(x=\sqrt{\lambda}/m^{2}\). The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations are solved to derive analytical fits for mass-radius relations, compactness, and \(f\)-mode frequencies. The parameter space is constrained using observational data (CMB/LSS, dwarf galaxies) and self-interaction bounds. Universal relations connecting \(f\)-mode frequencies, tidal deformability (\(\Lambda\)), and compactness (\(C\)) are explored, alongside GW detectability calculations using strain amplitude \(h(t)\) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) \(\rho = h_0 \sqrt{\tau/2S_n}\).","Analytical fits for scaled mass-radius relations and compactness in the strong-interaction limit are derived, with \(M_{\max}^{\prime}=0.06\), \(C_{\max}=0.16\), and \(R_{\max}^{\prime}=0.625\). The \(f\)-mode frequency \(f^{\prime}\) and damping time \(\tau^{\prime}\) are scaled as \(f^{\prime}=f x M_{Pl}\) and \(\tau^{\prime}=\tau / x M_{Pl}\), with hyperbola fits accurate to within \(3\%\). Universal relations for BSs include \(f(\mathrm{kHz})=-0.0045+0.21\sqrt{GM/R^3}\) and \(\frac{R^4}{M^3\tau}=0.111-0.386C\), distinct from neutron stars (NSs). The \(f\)-Love-\(C\) relations show errors <1%, and the dimensionless tidal deformability \(\Lambda\) decreases with mass, reaching \(\Lambda_{\text{min}}=280\). The detectable parameter space for \(f\)-modes is mapped against GW detectors, with thresholds \(x \leq 1.33 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{MeV}^{-2}\) (NEMO), \(5.32 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{MeV}^{-2}\) (LIGO), and \(2.66 \times 10^2 \, \text{MeV}^{-2}\) (LISA). The minimum damping time is \(\tau_{\min} = 1900 x M_{Pl}\), and the maximum BS mass spans \(M_{\max} = 0.06 x M_{Pl}^3\). Detection thresholds (\(\rho \geq 5\)) indicate LISA’s sensitivity to low-frequency, high-mass BSs, while next-gen detectors (CE, ET) enhance detectability within \(\approx 2\) AU for \(E=10^{-10} M_{\odot}\).","The strong-interaction regime (\(\Lambda \gg 1\)) allows BSs to mimic fermionic stars, with universal relations for \(f\)-modes and tidal deformability providing a robust framework for asteroseismology. These relations, independent of model parameters \((\lambda, m)\), enable distinction between BSs and NSs. The derived scaling laws and analytical fits align with prior studies but extend to the strong-coupling limit. Detectability analyses suggest LISA’s capability to probe high-mass BSs, while CE and ET improve sensitivity across the DM parameter space.","The study’s scaling relations and universal \(f\)-mode characteristics facilitate future detection of BSs via GW observations. Extensions to other interaction potentials (e.g., axion, vector bosons) and exotic compact objects (ECOs) are proposed. Stochastic GW backgrounds from BS binaries and long-lived \(f\)-modes could be probed by upcoming detectors like DECIGO and TianGO. The invariance of tidal Love numbers under scaling transformations supports universal relations for tidal deformability, aiding in distinguishing BSs from NSs. These findings advance GW asteroseismology as a tool to probe DM properties and compact object interiors."
2502.04016,From Planetesimals to Dwarf Planets by Pebble Accretion,Chris W. Ormel et al.,"The Kuiper Belt comprises two trans-Neptunian object (TNO) populations: dynamically cold TNOs, formed in-situ at \(\sim 45\) au, and hot TNOs, likely originating closer to the Sun (\(\sim 20\) au) before implantation via giant planet migration. Cold TNOs exhibit low inclinations, redder colors, and higher binary fractions, while hot TNOs show higher inclinations, neutral colors, and include more massive bodies like dwarf planets. Recent surveys (OSSOS, DEEP) reveal similar size distributions for cold and hot TNOs at low masses (\(H_{r} \gtrsim 5\)), consistent with streaming instability (SI). However, the high-mass end of the hot population's distribution is flattened, likely due to pebble accretion, which operated in the primordial belt but not in the cold population.","The study aims to explain the flattened high-mass tail of hot TNOs, quantify pebble accretion parameters (\(\tau_{s}\), \(\Delta v\), turbulent diffusivity \(\alpha_{D}\)), and link the observed size distribution to formation mechanisms. Pebble accretion, sensitive to disk conditions, is proposed to explain the growth of massive TNOs in a gas-rich disk before dynamical instability implanted them into the trans-Neptunian region. The work evaluates whether pebble accretion in environments resembling ALMA rings can reconcile the observed TNO mass function with solar system formation models.","The present-day mass distribution of dynamically hot TNOs within 48 au (P48) is reconstructed using Minor Planet Center (MPC) data, excluding cold classicals and Haumea family members. Dim TNOs (\(H_{r}>5\)) are modeled using a debiased OSSOS++ distribution fit by a broken power law. Pebble accretion rates depend on mass density (\(\rho_{\text{peb}}\)), relative velocity (\(\Delta v\)), and gravitational focusing, modulated by the stopping time (\(\tau_{s}\)) and turbulence. The model integrates growth via ordinary differential equations, normalized by solar mass and time \(t_0\), until pebble reservoir depletion. Parameters include initial mass distribution (\(m_{\text{brk}}\), \(m_{\text{imf}}\)), pebble properties (\(\sigma\), \(\tau_{s}\), \(m_{\text{Peb}}\)), and velocity fields (laminar or turbulent). Likelihood functions combine Gaussian and binomial statistics for OSSOS++ and MPC data, with priors constraining total pre-instability belt mass (\(14-28 m_{\oplus}\)) and individual body masses (\(\lesssim 1 m_{\oplus}\)). MCMC analysis marginalizes over parameters to fit observations.","MCMC fits favor pebble accretion dominating above \(m_{*} \sim 10^{-5} m_{\oplus}\), flattening the high-mass TNO distribution. Laminar models (lami-1p) show strong \(\tau_{s}\)-\(\Delta v\) correlations, favoring \(\tau_{s} \sim 10^{-2}\) and accretion times \(\sim 0.1–1\) Myr. Turbulent models require low \(\tau_{s}\), disfavored due to long accretion times inconsistent with gas-rich disk lifetimes. Simulations accrete \(5-8 m_{\oplus}\) of pebbles, aligning with initial mass function (IMF) constraints. Models overshoot observations at \(m=10^{-4} m_{\oplus}\) and undershoot at \(m=3 \times 10^{-3} m_{\oplus}\), reflecting statistical uncertainties. Adding a secondary pebble component does not improve fits (Bayes factors: 0.54 laminar, 0.18 turbulent).","The high-mass flattening arises from pebble accretion, which becomes efficient at \(m \sim 0.1 m_{*}\). Laminar models align with smooth disks (\(\eta \approx 5 \times 10^{-3}\)), while turbulent models correspond to ALMA-like pebble rings at pressure maxima (\(\eta \approx 0\)). Pebble accretion in laminar disks is inefficient due to small \(\tau_{s}\) (\(7 \times 10^{-4}\)) and long drift timescales (\(\sim 2\) Myr), requiring implausibly high pebble masses (\(>500 m_{\oplus}\)). Turbulent rings with \(\alpha_{D} \sim 10^{-3}\) and \(\tau_{s} \sim 0.01\) reconcile accretion timescales (\(\sim 0.4\) Myr) with disk lifetimes. The cold classical belt’s low mass (\(\sim 10^{-4} \times\) primordial belt) and distance (\(\sim 40\) au) hinder pebble accretion, favoring late formation or ring-based growth.","Pebble accretion in ALMA-like rings explains the hot TNO mass distribution, with constraints \(\tau_{s} \sim 0.01\), \(\alpha_{D} \sim 10^{-3}\), and \(v_{\text{frag}} \sim 2\) m/s. These rings consume \(\sim 10 m_{\oplus}\) of pebbles within \(\sim 0.4\) Myr, consistent with disk lifetimes. Massive TNOs (\(m_{\text{final}} > 10^{-4} m_{\oplus}\), Orcus-sized) likely meet dwarf planet criteria due to isotropic pebble settling forming spherical bodies. Future surveys (CLASSY, Vera C. Rubin Observatory) will refine accretion models by expanding high-mass TNO samples. The cold belt’s primordial low-mass distribution contrasts with the hot population’s pebble-modified profile, underscoring distinct formation pathways."
2502.03705,Dependence of Multi－band Absolute Magnitudes and Color Indexes of the Tip of Red Giant Branch Stars on Metallicity in the Galactic Globular Clusters,Zhishuai Ge et al.,"The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) stars, located at the top of the red giant branch in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, are pivotal for distance measurements and Hubble constant (\(H_0\)) determination. TRGB stars are particularly valued for their near-metallicity independence in the \(I\)-band absolute magnitude (\(M_{\mathrm{I}}\)), making them reliable distance calibrators. However, discrepancies exist between observational studies and theoretical models regarding metallicity dependence, with models predicting metallicity effects on TRGB luminosity. These discrepancies are critical in resolving tensions in \(H_0\) measurements, such as those arising from comparisons between SNe Ia and cosmic microwave background (CMB) results. Theoretical models suggest optical bands exhibit fainter magnitudes, while infrared bands show brighter magnitudes with increasing metallicity, driven by opacity effects.","This study aims to resolve inconsistencies between empirical calibrations and theoretical predictions of TRGB luminosity’s metallicity dependence. By leveraging Gaia DR3 data and analyzing TRGB stars in Galactic globular clusters, the work seeks to establish precise relationships between TRGB absolute magnitudes, color indexes, and metallicity across optical and near-infrared bands. The goal is to improve the reliability of TRGB as a standard candle for \(H_0\) measurements and address systematic uncertainties contributing to the Hubble tension.","Thirty-three Galactic globular clusters with homogeneous metallicity distributions (\(−2.5 < [\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}] < −0.5\)) were selected from Vasiliev \& Baumgardt (2021), ensuring no systematic bias. Clusters with >1000 stars and single stellar populations in color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) were prioritized. Membership probabilities >90% confirmed stellar associations. TRGB identification in clusters, unlike galaxies, required selecting the reddest RGB stars in CMDs as candidates, accounting for luminosity-magnitude conversion uncertainties and opacity effects in metal-rich clusters. AGB stars and long-period variables (LPVs) with photometric dispersions >0.05 mag were excluded, yielding 37 TRGB stars. Absolute magnitudes in optical (\(G_{\mathrm{BP}}, G_{\mathrm{RP}}, V, I\)) and near-infrared (\(J, H, K_{\mathrm{S}}\)) bands were derived using Gaia parallaxes, historical distances, and crossmatched data from 2MASS and OGLE.","For \([\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}] < -1.2\), \(M_{\mathrm{I}}\) remains nearly constant at \(-4.017 \pm 0.036 \pm 0.027\) mag, yielding \(H_0 = 70.86 \pm 1.2 \pm 0.9\) km/s/Mpc. At higher metallicities, \(M_{\mathrm{I}}\) becomes fainter, increasing \(H_0\). Optical bands (\(G_{\mathrm{BP}}, G_{\mathrm{RP}}, V\)) show magnitudes increasing (fainter) with metallicity, while infrared bands (\(J, H, K_{\mathrm{S}}\)) exhibit inverse trends. Analytical relations derived via least-squares fitting are:  
\[
\begin{gathered}
M_{G_{\mathrm{BP}}}=7.28 \times \exp (2.19 \times[\mathrm{Fe} / \mathrm{H}])-2.40, \\
M_{G_{\mathrm{RP}}}=0.13 \times[\mathrm{Fe} / \mathrm{H}]-3.66, \\
M_{V}=11.29 \times \exp (2.76 \times[\mathrm{Fe} / \mathrm{H}])-2.62, \\
M_{I}=10.47 \times \exp (3.92 \times[\mathrm{Fe} / \mathrm{H}])-4.017, \\
M_{J}=-0.07 \times[\mathrm{Fe} / \mathrm{H}]-5.18, \\
M_{K_{\mathrm{S}}}=-0.34 \times[\mathrm{Fe} / \mathrm{H}]-6.55.
\end{gathered}
\]  
Color indices \((G_{\mathrm{BP}}-G_{\mathrm{RP}}, V-I, J-K_{\mathrm{S}})\) exhibit smaller dispersion than absolute magnitudes. Two TRGB stars with infrared excess suggest circumstellar dust impacts metal-rich stars. Systematic uncertainties from distance, extinction, and photometry contribute 0.027 mag error in \(M_{\mathrm{I}}\).","The metallicity dependence of TRGB luminosity arises from increased opacity in metal-rich stars, shifting black-body radiation to longer wavelengths. This explains the inverse trends between optical and infrared bands. Discrepancies with LMC \(M_{\mathrm{I}}\) measurements (\(−4.038\) to \(−4.047\) mag vs. predicted \(−3.7\) mag) likely reflect metallicity differences between the LMC disk and halo. Theoretical models align with observed trends, where bolometric corrections amplify luminosity at longer wavelengths. Metallicity dominates TRGB luminosity variations, as age and mass loss effects are minimal in old globular clusters (10–13 Gyr). Infrared excess in metal-rich TRGBs implies circumstellar dust, further reducing their optical brightness.","The near-constancy of \(M_{\mathrm{I}}\) for \([\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}] < -1.2\) validates TRGB as a robust standard candle, yielding \(H_0\) consistent with Planck CMB estimates. For metal-rich systems (\([\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}] > -1.2\)), metallicity corrections are essential to avoid overestimating \(H_0\). Infrared bands provide complementary constraints with smaller systematic uncertainties. Future studies must account for metallicity gradients and circumstellar dust in metal-rich TRGB stars to refine distance measurements. These findings underscore the necessity of metallicity-aware calibrations in resolving the Hubble tension and advancing precision cosmology."
2502.04154,Searching for Internal Absorption Signatures in High-Redshift Blazars,A. Dmytriiev et al.,"Blazars, a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with jets aligned toward Earth, exhibit a two-bump spectral energy distribution (SED). The low-energy bump originates from synchrotron emission, while the high-energy bump’s origin is debated: leptonic models attribute it to inverse Compton (IC) scattering (synchrotron self-Compton or external inverse Compton involving photons from the broad-line region (BLR), accretion disk, or dusty torus), and hadronic models propose proton-photon interactions or proton synchrotron emission. Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), a blazar subclass dominated by external inverse Compton (EIC) processes, exhibit \(\gamma\)-ray emission arising from interactions of high-energy leptons/hadrons in the jet with ambient photon fields. The \(\gamma\)-ray emission region’s location along the jet remains uncertain, with studies suggesting positions near the BLR, beyond it, or near the dusty torus.","Internal \(\gamma-\gamma\) absorption, influenced by the BLR’s Ly \(\alpha\) photons, can constrain the \(\gamma\)-ray emission region’s location. For high-redshift \((z \gtrsim 3)\) sources, redshift shifts absorption features to lower energies, enhancing detectability. This study aims to search for these absorption features in Fermi-LAT data from nine high-redshift FSRQs to locate the \(\gamma\)-ray emission region relative to the supermassive black hole (SMBH).","The analysis uses Fermi-LAT data from nine high-redshift \((z \gtrsim 3)\) FSRQs (Paliya et al. 2020), covering MJD 54683 to MJD 59794 (August 4, 2008, to August 4, 2022). Photons between 100 MeV and 300 GeV were analyzed using Fermi Science Tools \(11-05-03\) and FERMIPY 1.0.1 with PASS 8 IRFs. Backgrounds were modeled using isotropic and Galactic diffuse templates, with 4FGL-DR4 sources within \(20^{\circ}\) included. The BLR photon field (dominated by Ly \(\alpha\), C IV, Mg II, and H \(\beta\) lines) was modeled using direct measurements or scaling relations (Finke 2016), with line luminosities derived from C IV or Mg II data. Internal \(\gamma-\gamma\) opacity was modeled using Böttcher \& Els (2016)'s code, integrating angle-dependent cross-sections for interactions between \(\gamma\)-rays and BLR photons. The BLR was modeled as a shell with radii \(R_{1} = 0.9 R_{\mathrm{BLR}}\) and \(R_{2} = 1.1 R_{\mathrm{BLR}}\), where \(R_{\mathrm{BLR}} \simeq 0.1\left(L_{\mathrm{D}, 46}\right)^{1 / 2} \mathrm{pc}\) (derived from disk luminosity \(L_{\mathrm{D}}\)). A composite spectral model incorporating intrinsic emission, internal absorption, and extragalactic background light (EBL) attenuation was used:  
\[
\frac{d N}{d E}=\frac{d N_{\text {intrinsic }}}{d E} \times \exp \left(-\tau_{\gamma-\gamma}\right) \times \exp \left(-\tau_{\text {EBL }}\right)
\]  
Binned likelihood analysis with FERMIPY tested variations in Test Statistic (TS) to constrain the emission region’s distance \(d\) from the SMBH.","A hint of internal \(\gamma-\gamma\) absorption was found in 4FGL J0733.8+0455 (Source 3, \(z=3.01\)), yielding \(d \geq 0.88 R_{\text {BLR}}\) with a TS improvement. For other sources, limited high-energy photon statistics (\(\gtrsim 5-6 \mathrm{GeV}\)) resulted in insignificant TS variations (\(\Delta \mathrm{TS} < 4\)), preventing distance constraints. The best-fit model for Source 3 suggests \(d / R_{\text{BLR}}=0.95_{-0.02}^{+0.09}\) (corresponding to \(d=0.19_{-0.004}^{+0.018} \mathrm{pc}\)), with a global TS maximum at \(d \approx 0.95 R_{\text{BLR}}\) (\(\mathrm{TS}_{\text{bf}}-\mathrm{TS}_0 \approx 3\), \(1.7 \sigma\)).","The detection of mild internal \(\gamma-\gamma\) opacity in Source 3 implies the \(\gamma\)-ray emitting region is located near the BLR’s inner boundary or within its central portion. The TS curve’s drop at \(d \approx 0.93 R_{\text{BLR}}\) (\(\approx 4 \sigma\) significance) rules out smaller distances. These results are independent of \(\gamma\)-ray production mechanisms but assume GeV emission occurs near the BLR. The one-zone emission model used may not capture multi-zone complexities, necessitating further studies.","High-redshift sources’ faintness limits photon statistics, but targeting intermediate-redshift \((z \sim 1-3)\) blazars with harder spectra could improve detectability of absorption features. The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), with a low energy threshold (\(\sim 10 \mathrm{GeV}\)), combined with Fermi-LAT, will enable continuous energy coverage for deeper exploration of internal \(\gamma-\gamma\) opacity. This promises precise constraints on \(\gamma\)-ray emitting regions and blazar environments, advancing understanding of jet physics and AGN structure."
2502.03913,ALMA observations of massive clouds in the central molecular zone: slim filaments tracing parsec-scale shocks,Kai Yang et al.,"The central molecular zone (CMZ) of the Galaxy, the inner 500 pc, hosts a massive (\(>10^{7} M_{\odot}\)), dense (\(>10^{4} \mathrm{cm}^{-3}\)) gas reservoir with inefficient star formation. It exhibits widespread SiO and complex organic molecule (COM) emissions, with parsec-scale shocks evidenced by broad molecular line widths (\(5-10 \mathrm{km/s}\)). These shocks are thought to heat the gas, decouple gas and dust temperatures, and drive ""hot-core like"" chemistry. High-resolution ALMA observations have revealed filamentary structures in CMZ clouds, but none directly linked to shocks.","The origins of shocks in the CMZ remain unclear, unlike in the Galactic disk where they are attributed to cloud collisions. Previous studies have not conclusively identified shock-driven filamentary structures in the CMZ, motivating high-resolution ALMA observations to investigate the dynamical and chemical processes underlying SiO and COM emissions.","Using ALMA’s C40-3 and C40-5 configurations, four CMZ clouds (\(20 \mathrm{km/s}\) cloud, \(50 \mathrm{km/s}\) cloud, cloud e, Sgr C) were observed at \(217-221 \mathrm{GHz}\) and \(231-235 \mathrm{GHz}\). Data reduction with CASA’s **tclean** task achieved a synthesized beam of \(0^{\prime \prime}.28 \times 0^{\prime \prime}.19\) (\(2200 \mathrm{AU} \times 1500 \mathrm{AU}\)) and a spectral rms of \(1.6-2.0 \mathrm{mJy/beam}\). Nine molecular lines, including SiO 5-4, \(c^{6}C_{3}H_{2}\), \(H_{2}CO\), and \(CH_{3}OH\), were detected. Filament skeletons were identified using FilFinder with a Medial Axis Transform method, applying thresholds for integrated intensity (\(>3 \sigma_{\text{area}}\)) and minimum area (125 pixels\(^2\)). Molecular column densities were calculated assuming LTE and optically thin emission using \(N_{\text {tot }}=\frac{8 \pi k_{\mathrm{B}} v^{2}}{h c^{3} A_{u l}} \frac{Q\left(T_{\mathrm{ex}}\right)}{g_{u}} \exp \left(\frac{E_{u}}{k_{\mathrm{B}} T_{\mathrm{ex}}}\right) \int T_{B} d v\), with spectroscopic parameters from CDMS, JPL, and LAMDA databases.","Slim filaments—long (\(>0.5 \mathrm{pc}\)), narrow (\(<0.03 \mathrm{pc}\)) structures—were detected in SiO 5-4 and eight other molecular lines, undetected in continuum. These filaments exhibit coherent velocities within \(\pm 5 \mathrm{km/s}\) of the cloud’s \(V_{\text{LSR}}\), inconsistent with outflows. Their average deconvolved width (0.024 pc) is narrower than nearby filaments, with velocity dispersions (\(\sigma_v\)) of 3.7–5.6 km/s (FWHM: 8.9–13.2 km/s). Position-velocity diagrams show no significant gradients, ruling out outflow origins. Relative molecular abundances resemble protostellar outflows (\(p=0.68\)), distinct from dense cores (\(p=0.02\)). Integrated maps of shock-tracing molecules (e.g., SO, \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}\), \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CN}\)) and Gaussian fits to SiO 5-4 spectra corroborate shock-driven kinematics.","The slim filaments challenge hydrostatic equilibrium models, as turbulent pressure (\(P_{\text{turb}} \approx 1.7 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{K\,cm}^{-3}\)) dominates over self-gravity (\(P_{\text{gravity}} \approx 1.3 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{K\,cm}^{-3}\)), indicating transient dynamics with a dissipation timescale of \(\sim 5.2 \times 10^{3}\) years. Their SiO abundances and Class I \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OH}\) masers suggest shock-driven origins, likely from interactions between magnetized clouds and parsec-scale shocks. Magnetic fields nearly perpendicular to filament skeletons align with shock compression models. The absence of dust emission may result from dust destruction or diffuse initial conditions.","These filaments represent a new class of structures sustained by parsec-scale shocks, replenishing SiO and COMs (\(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OH}\), \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CN}, \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}, \mathrm{HC}_{3} \mathrm{N}\)) in the CMZ. The estimated SiO replenishment rate (\(\sim 1.3 \times 10^{-4} M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\)) and surface density (\(\sim 0.7 \mathrm{pc}^{-2}\)) suggest they balance SiO depletion, maintaining widespread emissions. This process highlights the role of dynamic shock interactions in shaping CMZ chemistry and turbulence."
2502.04198,The Merging Galaxy Cluster Environment Affects the Morphology of Radio-AGN,Mary Rickel et al.,"Galaxy clusters significantly influence the properties and evolution of their member galaxies, including star formation rates, morphology, and AGN activity. Interactions such as ram pressure stripping and galaxy-galaxy harassment alter these properties. AGN, powered by supermassive black holes, are particularly affected, with radio-AGN showing distinct morphological changes in dense environments. Cluster-cluster mergers further disturb the intra-cluster medium (ICM), potentially triggering AGN activity and altering radio-AGN morphology. While the impact of mergers on the ICM is well-documented, their effect on cluster galaxies, especially AGN, remains unclear.","This study investigates how merging cluster environments influence radio-AGN morphology and their detection across radio and optical wavelengths, using data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) and Zooniverse.","The study uses a galaxy cluster sample from Bilton et al. (2020), derived from SDSS DR8, constrained by X-ray luminosity \(1 < L_X \leq 20 \times 10^{44} \mathrm{erg} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\) to ensure massive, well-assembled clusters. Cluster memberships were determined via surface caustics, with dynamical states classified using the Dressler & Shectman \(\Delta\)-test. AGN identification employed WHAN diagrams, using \(\mathrm{H}\alpha\) and [NII] \(\lambda 6584\) emission lines, with thresholds \(\log_{10}([\mathrm{NII}]/\mathrm{H}\alpha) \geq -0.32\) and \(\mathrm{EW}_{\mathrm{H}\alpha} \geq 6 \AA\). LoTSS data at 144 MHz with \(6^{\prime\prime}\) resolution was used to analyze radio properties.","A visual classification scheme categorized radio sources as Weak Compact (WC), Strong Compact (SC), Compact Extended (CE), FRI, FRII, FRM, Extended (E), Bent Tail (BT), Head Tail (HT), Undetermined, Bad Data, or No Detection. Five team members classified 191 radio-detected sources via Zooniverse, blinded to cluster dynamical states. Consensus levels for classifications were defined based on inter-classifier agreement. Compact radio sources were filtered to distinguish AGN from star formation using a \(3\times\) threshold comparing \(L_{150 \mathrm{MHz}}\) to star-formation-derived \(L_{150 \mathrm{MHz}, \mathrm{SF}}\). Bayesian credible intervals and Jeffreys intervals were used to compare proportions of radio morphologies in merging versus non-merging clusters.","# Results  
Non-merging clusters show proportions \(0.59_{-0.08}^{+0.08}\) (Compact) and \(0.16_{-0.05}^{+0.07}\) (Compact Extended), while merging clusters exhibit \(0.53_{-0.12}^{+0.12}\) (Compact) and \(0.06_{-0.04}^{+0.07}\) (Compact Extended), with no significant differences (\(\sigma<1\)). Extended sources are exclusive to non-mergers (\(0.14_{-0.06}^{+0.06}\)). Mergers show significantly more Disturbed sources (\(0.29_{-0.10}^{+0.11}\)) than non-mergers (\(0.03_{-0.02}^{+0.04}\)) at \(3\sigma\). Mergers also exhibit marginally more radio-only AGN (\(2\sigma\)) than radio+optical AGN (\(\operatorname{Pr}(\mathrm{AGN}_{\text{Rad}} > \mathrm{AGN}_{\text{Rad-Opt}}) = 0.96\)).","# Interpretation  
The \(3\sigma\) increase in disturbed radio sources in mergers is likely due to ICM bulk motion and ram pressure bending radio jets. Head-tail systems, indicative of extreme ram pressure, are exclusively found in mergers. The prevalence of WATs in mergers suggests bent morphology arises from cluster-cluster interactions rather than host galaxy motion. Radio-only AGN in mergers may link to low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs). Uncertainties exist in dynamical state determination, with potential misclassifications based on X-ray or radio halo observations."
2502.04278,Probing Spin-Orbit Resonances with the Binary Black Hole Population,Sylvia Biscoveanu et al.,"The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detectors have observed nearly 300 gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers, revealing substructure in mass distributions, small spin magnitudes, and evolving merger rates with redshift. Spin orientations are key discriminators of formation channels: field binaries are expected to have aligned spins, while dynamically formed systems exhibit random orientations. Recent studies using LVK data rule out anti-aligned spins but suggest isotropy, with tentative evidence for excess spin tilts around \(\cos \theta \sim 0.3\). The effective aligned spin, \(\chi_{\text{eff}}\), favors positive values, indicating a field binary contribution. Spin-orbit resonances (SORs), influenced by post-Newtonian (PN) dynamics and mass transfer, cause spin azimuth angles \(\phi_{12}\) to librate around \(0\) or \(\pm \pi\), distinguishing standard and reversed mass ratio scenarios.","This work introduces an astrophysically motivated model to constrain mass ratio reversal fractions, leveraging \(\phi_{12}\) inference and full parameter estimation to distinguish SORs. The goal is to probe formation channels (e.g., isolated binaries vs. dynamical capture) by identifying substructure in \(\phi_{12}\) distributions, potentially detectable by the end of LIGO's fourth observing run (O4).","Four BBH populations (200 events each) are simulated: strong resonances (aligned spins), mixed isotropic-resonant, fully isotropic, and weak resonances. Masses follow a Power-Law + Peak distribution, spins a Beta distribution, and redshifts a power-law up to \(z=1.9\). Spin tilts (\(\theta_{1,2}\)) and azimuths (\(\phi_{12}\)) are modeled using a mixture of isotropic and aligned components, with 30% undergoing mass ratio reversal (RMR). Bayesian parameter estimation is performed using BiLBY and the Dynesty nested sampler, with uniform priors for binary parameters and a comoving volume prior for luminosity distance. Waveform models (NRSur7dq4 for high masses, IMRPhenomXPHM for lower masses) are applied, and spin parameters are evolved to ISCO frequency post-inference. Hierarchical Bayesian inference using GWPopulation constrains hyper-parameters governing \(\phi_{12}\) distributions, incorporating von Mises models to test mixture fractions and peak locations. Selection biases are mitigated via Monte Carlo integrals over sensitivity injections.","For the strong resonances population, hyper-parameters for \(\cos \theta_{1}, \cos \theta_{2}, \phi_{12}\) are recovered within \(3\sigma\), with \(\phi_{12}\) driving constraints on \(f_{\text{RMR}}\) (posterior width \(\lesssim 0.7\)). The mixed population (strong SORs + isotropic) recovers true hyper-parameters within \(3\sigma\), with \(\phi_{12}\) providing additional information on mixture fractions. Fully isotropic populations show no spurious SOR evidence, with \(\phi_{12}\) distributions consistent with isotropy. Weak resonances align better with GWTC-3 data, showing no narrow aligned components but recovering true \(\phi_{12}\) distributions at high credibility. GWTC-3 analysis reveals no strong SOR evidence but hints at \(\phi_{12} = \pm \pi\) excesses. Spin tilt distributions are roughly flat, with mixture fractions (\(\xi\)) constrained to \(\lesssim 0.3\) at \(95\%\) credibility.","The \(\phi_{12}\) distribution is the primary discriminator of SORs, with excesses at \(0, \pm \pi\) indicative of mass ratio reversal scenarios. Hierarchical inference recovers true hyper-parameters for simulated populations but faces challenges in astrophysical interpretation due to model-dependent \(\xi\) posteriors and prior degeneracies. While O4 data may not definitively confirm SORs, they can distinguish weak resonances from tidal effects. GWTC-3 results caution against overinterpreting phenomenological hyper-parameters, as they weakly proxy astrophysical fractions.","This study demonstrates the feasibility of probing SORs via hierarchical analysis of BBH populations, offering insights into formation channels and dynamics. The \(\phi_{12}\) distribution’s sensitivity to mass ratio reversal fractions highlights its utility in distinguishing isolated binaries from dynamical captures. However, current methods require larger catalogs and improved models to mitigate biases in spin magnitude recovery and prior-driven uncertainties. Future work should refine tilt models and explore density estimators for robust inference."
2502.03995,Modeling fast X-ray variability around an accreting black hole,Yejing Zhan et al.,"Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) consist of a stellar-mass black hole accreting matter from a companion star, forming an accretion disc where viscosity facilitates angular momentum transfer. Outbursts in BHXRBs, driven by disc instabilities, produce multi-wavelength radiation, predominantly in X-rays, with spectral and timing variations occurring over days to years. X-ray variability, observed down to millisecond timescales, includes broad-band noise and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), the latter potentially linked to relativistic disc precession. Hard lags, where high-energy photons lag low-energy ones, are observed at low Fourier frequencies, attributed to accretion rate fluctuations propagating from outer to inner disc regions. At high frequencies, soft lags occur, explained by reverberation from disc reflection. The zero-crossing point, where soft lags transition to hard lags, offers insights into inner accretion flow geometry but remains poorly understood. Recent studies in systems like MAXI J1820+070 reveal evolving hard and soft lags, with soft lags shortening in timescale during outbursts. Models like Reltrans and Wilkins et al. (2016) attempt to explain these lags, but observational evidence suggests an extended corona and multiple emission components.","This study aims to explore how disc viscosity and corona geometry influence X-ray lag evolution during BHXRB outbursts, addressing the unresolved nature of the zero-crossing point and the need for comprehensive simulations that incorporate both propagating fluctuations and reverberation effects. Future polarization observations from IXPE and eXTP are highlighted as critical tools for clarifying corona geometry, motivating the development of models that can be tested against these upcoming datasets.","The study employs Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations of a jet base corona, incorporating accretion rate fluctuations and reverberation delays. The corona is modeled as a hyperbolic surface parameterized by semi-major axis \(a=10 R_g\), semi-minor axis \(b=2 R_g\), and height boundaries \(h_t, h_b\). Radiative processes include disc thermal emission (Novikov-Thorne model), Comptonization in the corona, and disc reflection, producing spectra with power-law cutoffs, emission lines, and Compton humps. Photons are traced geometrically in a Newtonian framework, with variability introduced via propagating accretion rate fluctuations (Ingram & Done 2011; 2012 framework). Reflection is modeled using García et al. (2013) and Dauser et al. (2013), with the Xillver model interpolating parameters \(\Gamma\), \(\xi\), \(A_{\mathrm{Fe}}\), and \(i\). Shielding effects are approximated using a two-zone corona with transmittance values \(\kappa_{1}\) and \(\kappa_{2}\), and radius \(r_{\text{cover}}\). Simulations capture light curves for disc, Compton, and reflection components over 200 seconds with 1/1000-second resolution.","Simulations reproduce observed inter-band lag spectra, showing low-frequency hard lags and high-frequency soft lags. Key parameters include a black hole mass \(M=7 M_{\odot}\), accretion rate \(\dot{m}=0.01\), disc temperature \(T_i=0.15 \mathrm{keV}\), inner radius \(r_{\text{in}}=10 R_g\), and viscous factor \(\alpha=0.1\). The time-averaged spectrum exhibits a cutoff power-law (\(\Gamma \sim 2\)), thermal peak (\(\sim 0.1 \mathrm{keV}\)), and high-ionized reflection. As corona height decreases from \(35 R_g\) to \(16 R_g\) and maximum viscous frequency increases from 2 Hz to 30 Hz, soft lag amplitudes diminish, and zero-crossing points shift to higher frequencies, aligning with observed trends in MAXI J1820+070. Propagation lads dominate at low frequencies due to delays between outer and inner disc regions, while spatial lags prevail at high frequencies.","The observed lag evolution arises from the interplay between corona geometry and disc viscosity. Low-frequency hard lags are driven by viscous propagation delays, while high-frequency soft lags result from reverberation effects and light travel times. A spherical corona model also reproduces lag patterns, but polarization studies (e.g., IXPE) favor a vertically extended geometry. Energy-dependent lag spectra below 1 keV match observations, but deviations above 1 keV suggest unmodeled coronal fluctuation propagation. Simplified assumptions, such as neglecting heating effects, may limit the model’s accuracy, necessitating future refinements.","The study underscores the importance of X-ray polarization observations from IXPE and eXTP in distinguishing corona geometries. Simulations suggest that evolving lag patterns during BHXRB outbursts can constrain corona size and disc viscosity, providing a framework for interpreting future timing and spectral data. Incorporating coronal fluctuation propagation and refining shielding approximations will enhance model fidelity, aiding in the understanding of accretion physics and relativistic processes near black holes."
2502.03730,On the relationship between the cosmic web and the alignment of galaxies and AGN jets,S. Lyla Jung et al.,"The evolution of galaxies is influenced by active galactic nuclei (AGN) through radiative and mechanical feedback mechanisms, which regulate star formation. While these feedback modes are often considered distinct, recent studies suggest overlap, with many AGN exhibiting mixed characteristics. The alignment of radio jets with host galaxies and the cosmic web remains a critical area of study, as cosmic filaments shape large-scale matter flows and galaxy evolution.","This study investigates the orientations of radio jets and their optical counterparts relative to cosmic filaments to understand how cosmic environments influence AGN activity and galaxy structure. By leveraging multiwavelength data, the work aims to clarify the interplay between filamentary accretion, galaxy mergers, and jet alignment, addressing gaps in understanding the environmental dependence of AGN feedback and intrinsic galaxy alignments.","The analysis combines data from LOFAR’s LoTSS DR2 (identifying ~4 million radio sources), DESI Legacy Surveys (providing optical properties and ellipticities), and SDSS DR12 (utilizing the DisPerSE algorithm to identify cosmic filaments at \(z \approx 0-0.8\)). Two samples are analyzed: the General Massive Radio Galaxy (GMRG) sample (84,409 sources, \(M_* > 10^{11} M_\odot\)) for optical-filament alignments, and the Extended Jet (EJ) subset (7,297 sources with \(L_{144} > 10^{24} \, \mathrm{W \, Hz^{-1}}\), \(LAS > 20^{\prime\prime}\)) for jet-host galaxy alignments. Filament proximity is measured using 3D Cartesian coordinates, with orientation vectors converted to spherical coordinates for alignment comparisons. The parallel transport method ensures accurate angular comparisons, and spectroscopic redshifts (\(z < 0.6\)) prioritize precise 3D localization.","Galaxies within \(\lesssim 11 \, \mathrm{Mpc}\) of cosmic filaments align their optical major axes parallel to filaments, with the strongest alignment near filament spines (\(\lesssim 6 \, \mathrm{Mpc}\)). Radio jets generally orient perpendicularly to host galaxy major axes, peaking at \(90^\circ\), particularly for galaxies with higher optical ellipticity (\(\left|\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}\right| > 0.05\)). However, within \(\lesssim 8 \, \mathrm{Mpc}\) of filaments, jet orientations become randomized, showing reduced skewness (\(p = 0.036\) via KS tests) and a higher fraction of misaligned jets (\(60.2\%\) vs. \(56.2\%\) at larger distances).","The alignment of galaxy major axes with filaments suggests growth via mergers channeled along filaments, consistent with simulations of directional accretion in massive halos. The perpendicular jet-galaxy alignment reflects secular accretion processes, while randomization near filaments implies chaotic gas accretion driven by galaxy interactions in dense environments. Projection effects confirm the physical origin of these trends, linking cosmic web dynamics to AGN activity.","Intrinsic galaxy alignments with filaments (\(M_* > 10^{11} M_\odot\)) necessitate corrections in weak lensing surveys to avoid cosmological biases. Anisotropic AGN jet feedback influences circumgalactic medium (CGM) properties, but environmental dependence near filaments reduces predictability. These findings underscore the role of cosmic filaments in shaping galaxy evolution, AGN feedback modes, and CGM anisotropy, informing models of large-scale structure and feedback efficacy."
2502.04114,"SIMULTANEOUS EXISTENCE OF THE OSCILLATIONS, COUNTERSTREAMING FLOWS AND MASS INJECTIONS IN SOLAR QUIESCENT PROMINENCES",Xiaoli Yan et al.,"Solar quiescent prominences are cool, dense structures (\(\mathrm{T}<2 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~K}\), \(10^{9}<\mathrm{n}_{e}<10^{11} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}\)) suspended in the hot corona, lasting days to months. They consist of a spine, bubbles, and legs (barbs). Counterstreaming flows, first observed in active regions, are prevalent in quiescent prominences, with velocities of 8 to 15 \(\mathrm{km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\). Prominences also exhibit periodic mass movements and oscillations, often triggered by wave or jet interactions. Despite advancements in observational capabilities, the driving mechanism of counterstreaming flows remains unclear. Simulations suggest turbulent heating at the solar surface may play a role.","This study aims to elucidate the dynamics of counterstreaming flows, oscillations, and mass injections in solar quiescent prominences, leveraging high-resolution data from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST), Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to analyze a prominence observed on 2016 August 17. The unclear driving mechanisms of counterstreaming flows and the interplay between oscillations and mass injections motivate this investigation.","NVST observed the prominence on 2016 August 17 using \(\mathrm{H} \alpha\) line-center and off-band images at \(6562.8 \AA, 6562.8 \pm 0.4 \AA\), and \(6562.8 \pm 0.7 \AA\), with a spatial resolution of \(0.^{\prime \prime} 3\) and cadence of \(\sim 76 \mathrm{~s}\). Data were calibrated and coaligned with an accuracy of \(0.^{\prime \prime} 1\). SDO/AIA provided EUV images at \(304 \AA, 171 \AA\), and \(211 \AA\) with a 12 s cadence. IRIS captured Mg II h 2803.5 spectra with 5 large coarse raster scans. Dopplergrams were constructed to analyze Doppler shift signals, and velocities were derived from linear fits to time-distance diagrams. Gauss fitting profiles at asterisk points in Figs. 4a and 4d (marked by black circles) were used to denote peak intensity, Doppler velocity, and line width.","The prominence exhibited emissive structures in \(304 \AA\) and \(\mathrm{H} \alpha\), absorptive structures in \(211 \AA\), and mixed features in \(171 \AA\). The spine, nearly parallel to the limb, included bubbles and legs (barbs). Counterstreaming flows dominated the central spine, with velocities of 4 to 11 \(\mathrm{km} \mathrm{s}^{-1}\), confirmed by \(\mathrm{H} \alpha\) center and off-band images and Dopplergrams. Longitudinal oscillations in the spine had an 83-minute period and 32 Mm amplitude, with velocities of 11 to 17 \(\mathrm{km} \mathrm{s}^{-1}\). Transverse oscillations of threads perpendicular to the spine showed periods of 12 to 17 minutes and amplitudes of ~3 Mm. Doppler signals revealed alternating blueshifts and redshifts, with randomness in the lower spine due to mass injections. Two types of mass injections were identified: upward plumes from bubble boundaries (velocities of 22 to 30 \(\mathrm{km} \mathrm{s}^{-1}\), redshifted Doppler signals) and tornado-like barbs (velocities of 6 to 15 \(\mathrm{km} \mathrm{s}^{-1}\), redshifted signals). Blueshifted signals in another region indicated upward mass flows at 5 to 11 \(\mathrm{km} \mathrm{s}^{-1}\).","The upper spine’s longitudinal oscillations align with simulations of prominence dynamics, while the lower spine’s irregularity stems from intermittent mass injections. Counterstreaming flows arise from the interplay between longitudinal oscillations and mass injections, with blueshifted and redshifted Doppler signals reflecting injection sites on opposite sides of the spine. The coexistence of unidirectional flows in \(\mathrm{H} \alpha \pm 0.4 \AA\) images and alternating Doppler velocities in Mg II h \(2803.5 \AA\) observations corroborate these dynamics.","The findings support both chromospheric evaporation-coronal condensation and direct injection models of prominence formation and sustenance. The simultaneous existence of oscillations, counterstreaming flows, and mass injections highlights their ongoing role in prominence dynamics, advancing the understanding of how these structures remain suspended in the corona. The study demonstrates the necessity of multi-instrument observations to unravel complex solar phenomena."

Despite their faintness, CT-AGNs are significant contributors to the cosmic X-ray background (CXB), with models suggesting they constitute \(30\%\) or more of the AGN population. However, observed fractions, such as in the COSMOS survey, are much lower, indicating many CT-AGNs remain hidden, particularly in AGNs with low X-ray photon counts.","This work aims to identify these obscured CT-AGNs by analyzing multiwavelength data from a sample of 440 AGNs in the COSMOS survey. The motivation stems from the discrepancy between theoretical predictions of CT-AGN abundance and their observed underrepresentation, highlighting the need for improved detection methods to uncover the missing population and refine AGN demographic models.","The study utilized multiwavelength data from the COSMOS survey, including X-ray observations from Chandra and XMM-Newton, UV-FIR photometry from COSMOS2020 and COSMOS2015 catalogs, and optical-NIR spectra from Hasinger et al. (2018). A sample of 440 AGNs was selected based on extragalactic origin, reliable optical counterparts, low X-ray counts (<30 in \(0.5-7 \mathrm{keV}\)), and multiwavelength coverage. Redshifts were prioritized from spectroscopic sources, with photometric redshifts used otherwise, and X-ray luminosities corrected using \(\frac{L_{\text{new}}}{L_{\text{old}}} = \frac{R(z_{\text{new}})^{2}(1+z_{\text{new}})^{\Gamma-2}}{R(z_{\text{old}})^{2}(1+z_{\text{old}})^{\Gamma-2}}\) (\(\Gamma = 1.4\)). SED fitting with CIGALE derived AGN and host galaxy properties, including rest-frame \(6 \mu \mathrm{m}\) luminosities, stellar masses (\(\mathrm{M}_{\star}\)), and star formation rates (\(\mathrm{SFR} = 1.09 \times 10^{-9}(3.3 \mathrm{~L}_{\mathrm{UV}} + \mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{IR}})\)). Optical-NIR spectral decomposition using PyQSOFit extracted emission line luminosities. CT-AGN diagnostics compared observed \(2-10 \mathrm{keV}\) luminosities to \(6 \mu \mathrm{m}\) (MIR) and high-ionization emission lines ([O III] \(\lambda 5007\), [Ne V] \(\lambda 3426\)), with [O III] estimated from [O II] \(\lambda 3727\) for \(z > 1\) sources. Bayesian information criterion (BIC) assessed AGN component reliability in SEDs. X-ray spectral modeling incorporated absorption, reflection, and scattering components via \(\text{phabs} * \text{powerlaw} + \text{constant} * \text{powerlaw} + \text{pexmon}\).","From 440 AGNs, 18 CT-AGNs were identified: 3 via MIR diagnostics, 16 via emission lines ([O III], [Ne V]), and one overlapping source. Four AGNs showed discrepancies between MIR and emission line classifications, potentially due to variability or [O III] overestimation from [O II]. The CT-AGN fraction (4.1%) remained below theoretical predictions. Host galaxy properties (\(\mathrm{M}_{\star}\), SFR) showed no significant differences between CT-AGNs and non-CT-AGNs, supported by Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.","Diagnostic discrepancies for four AGNs may arise from temporal variability or [O III] luminosity estimation uncertainties. The low CT-AGN fraction suggests selection biases, such as reliance on high-ionization lines and SED fitting limitations. Underestimation of [O III] luminosities due to assumed [O II]/[O III] ratios (0.1–0.6) might miss CT-AGNs. The absence of host galaxy differences challenges models linking CT-AGNs to distinct environments, possibly reflecting high-redshift AGN diversity.",This study underscores the necessity of multiwavelength approaches to detect obscured CT-AGNs and reconcile observed fractions with CXB models. The lack of host galaxy property differences questions evolutionary scenarios associating CT-AGNs with specific galactic conditions. Future efforts must address identification biases and incorporate advanced spectroscopic techniques to uncover the missing CT-AGN population.
2502.03742,Radio emission from little red dots may reveal their true nature,Muhammad A. Latif et al.,"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has identified a population of compact, reddish objects with broad line emission features, termed little red dots (LRDs), at \(z=4-10\). These objects challenge our understanding of early universe AGN and galaxy formation. Their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) suggest they could be either extremely starbursting galaxies or highly obscured AGN. If star formation (SF) dominates, their inferred stellar masses (\(10^{10}-10^{11} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\)) are unusually large for such redshifts. However, spectroscopic evidence, including narrow unresolved lines like [O III], points toward LRDs being dust-reddened AGN with bolometric luminosities \(L_{\text{bol}}=10^{43-46} \mathrm{erg} \mathrm{s}^{-1}\) and BH masses \(10^{6}-10^{8} M_{\odot}\). Their cosmic abundance (\(\sim 10^{-5} \mathrm{Mpc}^{-3} \mathrm{mag}^{-1}\)) is significantly higher than quasars at similar redshifts. X-ray detections are rare, and current radio surveys (e.g., Meerkat, VLA) have not detected LRDs, suggesting they are likely radio-quiet AGN.","LRDs offer critical insights into AGN-galaxy coevolution, BH seeding, and cosmic reionization. JWST NIR observations remain inconclusive, and existing radio surveys lack the sensitivity to confirm their nature. Future observations with ngVLA and SKA could resolve their properties. This work aims to estimate radio emission from LRDs to guide upcoming surveys and determine whether their radio signals originate from AGN activity or host galaxy processes.","Radio flux at \(0.1-10 \mathrm{GHz}\) from BHs in LRDs is estimated using the fundamental plane (FP) of BH accretion, relating nuclear radio luminosity (\(L_{\mathrm{R}}\)), BH mass (\(M_{\mathrm{BH}}\)), and X-ray luminosity (\(L_{\mathrm{X}}\)) at 2-10 keV: \(\log L_{\mathrm{R}} = A \log L_{\mathrm{X}} + B \log M_{\mathrm{BH}} + C\). Coefficients \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) account for radio-loud and radio-quiet sources. Using \(L_{\mathrm{X}}\) upper limits (\(10^{43}-10^{44} \mathrm{erg} \mathrm{s}^{-1}\)) and \(M_{\mathrm{BH}}\) values (\(10^{6}-10^{7} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\)), \(L_{\mathrm{R}}\) is computed. Observed radio flux is redshifted into ngVLA and SKA bands, assuming a spectral index \(\alpha=0.3\), and calculated via \(F_{v} = \frac{L_{v^{\prime}}(1+z)}{4 \pi d_{\mathrm{L}}^{2}}\). Host galaxy radio emission is estimated using an empirical relation from Delhaize et al. (2017), incorporating redshift dependence and an IMF factor \(f_{IMF}=1.7\). Stellar flux is derived using \(f_{v_{\text{obs}}} = \frac{L_{R}(1+z)^{\alpha+1}}{4 \pi d_{\mathrm{L}}^{2}}\left(\frac{1.4}{v_{\text{obs}}}\right)^{\alpha}\) with \(\alpha=0.7\), assuming SFRs of 1, 10, and \(30 M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\).","In the standard scenario, AGN-to-SFR flux ratios at \(z=7\) range from 0.1-40 for \(\mathrm{SFR}=1 M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\), with AGN dominating except at minimum fluxes. For \(\mathrm{SFR}=10 M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\), ratios drop to 0.02-4, and for \(\mathrm{SFR}=30 M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\), ratios decrease to 0.002-2. AGN radio fluxes range from 1-3000 nJy, decreasing with redshift, while host galaxy fluxes vary from 10-1000 nJy. In radio-loudness scenarios, AGN fluxes (20,000-2,000,000 nJy) dominate across all SFRs. Current surveys (VLASS, FIRST, COSMOS) have not detected radio-loud LRDs, with one detection (~0.15 \(\mu \mathrm{Jy} /\) beam) suggesting radio-quiet AGN. ngVLA could detect AGN with \(M_{\mathrm{BH}} \geq 10^{6.5} M_{\odot}\) at \(z<5\) in 1 hr, while SKA requires ~100 hr. Signals above ~2000 nJy at \(z=3-4\) or ~500 nJy at \(z>5\) would indicate AGN presence.","The results suggest LRDs are likely radio-quiet AGN, aligning with the lack of radio-loud detections in current surveys. AGN fluxes dominate host emissions only at lower SFRs (\(1 M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\)) or higher BH masses (\(10^{7} M_{\odot}\)). Radio-loud scenarios produce detectable fluxes but are inconsistent with existing non-detections. The spectral index \(\alpha\) (0.3–0.7) shows minimal impact on conclusions. Super-Eddington accretion scenarios could explain obscuration but do not affect radio emission predictions.","Future observations with ngVLA and SKA can resolve the nature of LRDs by detecting AGN fluxes above \(\sim 2000 \mathrm{nJy}\) at \(z=3-4\) or \(\sim 500 \mathrm{nJy}\) at \(z>5\), contingent on SFRs \(<30 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\). Confirming radio-quiet AGN in LRDs would advance understanding of early BH growth, AGN-galaxy coevolution, and the role of obscured AGN in cosmic reionization. Current non-detections already constrain radio-loud fractions, emphasizing the need for deeper surveys to probe radio-quiet regimes."
2502.03941,Gaps in Stellar Streams as a Result of Globular Cluster Fly-Bys: The Case of Palomar 5,Salvatore Ferrone et al.,"Thin stellar streams, such as those of Palomar 5, are formed by tidal disruption of globular clusters or dwarf galaxies and trace the gravitational potential of their host galaxies. Differential gravitational forces stretch these systems into long tidal tails, first predicted in the 1970s and observed in the 1990s with discoveries like the Sagittarius stream and Palomar 5’s tails. Palomar 5, a low-mass globular cluster, has tails extending over 20 degrees, containing more mass than the cluster itself. Advances in surveys like SDSS, Pan-STARRS, and Gaia have enabled the discovery of dozens of streams, allowing detailed orbital and chemical characterization. These streams probe the Milky Way’s gravitational field, including its dark matter halo, with studies revealing both triaxial and spherical halo shapes at different distances. Streams also constrain the granularity of dark matter sub-halos predicted by \(\Lambda\)CDM models, with gaps in streams like Palomar 5 and GD-1 attributed to sub-halo interactions. However, baryonic structures, such as the Galactic bar and giant molecular clouds, can also create stream gaps, complicating interpretations.","Recent studies suggest that globular clusters’ impact on stellar streams is negligible, but this may not hold for inner Galaxy streams like Palomar 5, where clusters are densely populated. Ishchenko et al. (2023b) demonstrated that cluster collisions are plausible, implying stream interactions could be frequent. This work aims to quantify globular clusters’ effects on Palomar 5’s stream, simulating interactions with 165 Galactic clusters to challenge prior claims that cluster passages are rare.","The study models Palomar 5’s stream using the restricted three-body problem, incorporating key extra-cluster physics like disk shocking. Initial conditions for 165 clusters are derived from Baumgardt & Vasiliev (2021), converted to a Galactocentric frame. The Galactic potential model from Pouliasis et al. (2017) is used, time-independent over 5 Gyr. Mutual \(N\)-body interactions among clusters are modeled as Plummer spheres with masses and radii from the Baumgardt catalog. Initial positions and velocities are integrated backward for 5 Gyr under the Galactic potential and mutual cluster influences. Forward integration simulates Palomar 5’s evolution using 100,000 particles, accounting for gravitational effects from the Galaxy and all clusters, excluding self-gravity. The process is repeated 50 times with Monte-Carlo sampling to handle uncertainties in cluster properties. A leapfrog integrator with a 10,000-year time-step ensures numerical stability, and reverse integrability tests confirm precision. Reference simulations exclude mutual cluster interactions to isolate their impact.","Globular clusters significantly affect Palomar 5’s stream, creating observable gaps in its density profile. Simulations reveal 73 gaps, averaging 1.5 per simulation, with 65 in the leading tail and 8 in the trailing tail. Gaps, such as those induced by NGC 2808, NGC 7078, and NGC 104, form due to close passages, with recent interactions producing narrower gaps. The gap creation rate, \(\mathcal{R}_{\text{Pal 5}}\), is derived by normalizing gap occurrences over time and stream length, yielding a weighted mean of \(0.009 \, \text{km s}^{-1} \text{kpc}^{-2}\). Gaps are predominantly caused by close encounters with impact parameters <200 pc, while gaps are absent for parameters >300 pc. The change in momentum (\(\Delta p\)) imparted by gap-producing flybys is ~10x higher than non-gap encounters, with \(\Delta p \approx 2 \frac{GM}{b\delta v}\), where \(M\) is the perturber’s mass, \(b\) the impact parameter, and \(\delta v\) the relative velocity. Gap-causing clusters are confined to an energy range of -2 to \(-1 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~km}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}\) and follow both direct and retrograde orbits. Gap impacts occur at all orbital phases, but their frequency decreases with galactocentric radius, following \(N=-2.5 r+50\), suggesting cluster density near the Galactic center drives gap formation.","Simulations show Palomar 5’s stream likely experienced multiple globular cluster encounters in the last 5 Gyr, creating gaps up to a few kpc wide. While 73 gaps were found in 50 realizations, only ~22 extend beyond the observed stream length, averaging at least one gap per simulation. Observational challenges, such as field star contamination and magnitude limits, complicate gap detection, suggesting our results may represent an upper limit. Globular clusters’ historical masses were likely higher, implying more perturbers and gaps in the past. These findings contrast with Banik & Bovy (2019), who found negligible globular cluster impact, potentially due to their focus on power spectra rather than individual gaps. Similarly, Doke & Hattori (2022) concluded low gap-creation likelihood for GD-1, but this may not apply to Palomar 5 due to its closer Galactic pericenter.","The study demonstrates that baryonic components, such as globular clusters, can create gaps in stellar streams, challenging the assumption that such gaps solely indicate dark matter sub-halo interactions. This complicates interpretations of dark matter distribution in the Milky Way, particularly in inner Galaxy regions where baryonic effects dominate. Future studies should extend this analysis to other streams and incorporate evolving Galactic potentials and cluster populations to refine constraints on dark matter sub-halo properties. The results underscore the need to account for baryonic perturbers in stream morphology studies."
2502.04211,Exploring the limits of nucleonic metamodelling using different relativistic density functionals,Prasanta Char and Chiranjib Mondal,"Neutron stars (NSs) provide a unique laboratory for studying matter at densities several times nuclear saturation density (\(n_{\text{sat}}\)). The equation of state (EOS) of NS matter remains uncertain, though constraints have emerged from radio observations of massive pulsars, the multimessenger event GW170817, and X-ray measurements by NICER. Direct EOS calculations from quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are impractical due to its strong coupling at nuclear densities. Effective field theories, particularly relativistic mean-field (RMF) models with density-dependent meson-baryon couplings, are widely used to describe nuclear matter and finite nuclei properties. Two specific RMF models—Typel-Wolter (TW) and Gogelein et al. (GDFM)—are studied here, with TW applied to finite nuclei and astrophysical simulations, and GDFM exploring NS crust properties and relativistic metamodelling.","This work systematically compares TW and GDFM models using a metamodelling approach to assess their ability to generate diverse NS compositions and implications for machine learning-based EOS inference. The study addresses the obscuration of composition information in \(\beta\)-equilibrium, necessitating observations of non-equilibrium phenomena to clarify high-density matter properties.","The Lagrangian density for both models includes nucleon and meson fields (\(\psi, \sigma, \omega_{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\rho}_{\mu}\)) with density-dependent couplings \(\Gamma_i(n_B)\). TW employs \(\Gamma_i(n_B) = \Gamma_i(n_{\text{sat}}) f_i(x)\), where \(f_i(x)\) is a rational function, while GDFM uses \(\Gamma_i(n_B) = a_i + (b_i + d_i x^3) e^{-c_i x}\) with \(x = n_B / n_0\). Parameters for nuclear empirical properties (e.g., \(n_{\text{sat}}\), \(E_{\text{sat}}\), \(K_{\text{sat}}\), \(E_{\text{sym}}\), \(L_{\text{sym}}\)) are constrained within specific ranges. A Bayesian analysis incorporates nuclear and astrophysical constraints, generating unified EOSs and solving Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. The crust-core junction is matched using a compressible liquid drop approach with nonrelativistic (NR) metamodelling. Nested Sampling (PyMultiNest) optimizes parameter sets, incorporating \(\chi\)-EFT constraints and astrophysical limits from pulsar masses, GW170817, and NICER.","Both models yield similar EOSs and NS mass-radius sequences but differ significantly in proton fractions at high densities. GDFM exhibits broader ranges for symmetry energy parameters (\(K_{\text{sym}}\), \(Q_{sym}^{*}\), \(Z_{sym}^{*}\)) due to its parametric freedom in \(\rho\)-meson coupling, while TW shows narrower ranges. Pearson correlations reveal distinct NMP interactions, with astrophysical constraints reducing prior correlations. GDFM’s pressure is stiffer at low densities but softer at high densities compared to TW. Proton fractions in GDFM reach up to \(\sim 0.45\) (priors) and \(\sim 0.3\) (posteriors), contrasting with TW’s saturation between 0.12–0.2. Mass-tidal deformability relations align with NICER observations, though TW explores lower radii and tidal deformability in priors. Both models converge in posteriors for \(M-R\) and \(M-\Lambda\) sequences, with GDFM exhibiting broader proton fraction variations due to isovector Lagrangian freedom.","The results demonstrate that \(\beta\)-equilibrated EOSs alone cannot constrain NS composition, as composition information is obscured in equilibrium conditions. Differences in higher-order parameters (\(Q_{\text{sat}}^{*}\), \(Z_{\text{sat}}^{*}\), \(Q_{\text{sym}}^{*}\), \(Z_{\text{sym}}^{*}\)) between models highlight the influence of Lagrangian variations on NS cooling and transport behaviors. GDFM’s flexibility in the isovector sector enables exploration of diverse symmetry energy behaviors, challenging prior assumptions about EOS constraints.","The study underscores the necessity of explicit symmetry energy information and non-equilibrium observations to resolve NS composition uncertainties. Funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program (Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant No. 101034371), Horizon MSCA-2022-PF-01-01 (Grant No. 101109652), and support from FNRS, FWO, and EOS Project nr O022818F and O000422 enabled this research, advancing the understanding of neutron star matter and its EOS."
2502.04264,Fundamental Oscillation Modes in Neutron Stars with Hyperons and Delta Baryons,O. P. Jyothilakshmi et al.,"Gravitational wave (GW) detections from binary neutron star (NS) mergers provide new constraints on the equations of state (EoSs) of dense matter. Neutron star oscillations, particularly fundamental (\(f\)-) modes, emit gravitational waves detectable by observatories like LIGO/VIRGO and the Einstein Telescope. The relativistic Cowling approximation, used in this study, differs from a full general relativistic treatment by less than 20%. Tidal deformability (\(\Lambda\)) derived from GW signals further constrains EoSs. The modified chiral model, incorporating higher-order mesonic interactions, addresses the softening effect of exotic matter while maintaining stiff EoSs for massive NS configurations.",The study investigates \(f\)-mode oscillations in NSs containing hyperons and delta (\(\Delta\)) baryons to understand their role in GW emissions and EoS properties. It aims to reconcile the presence of exotic matter with the requirement for stiff EoSs to support observed NS masses. The analysis leverages tidal deformability constraints from GW events and aims to provide insights into the internal composition of NSs through \(f\)-mode frequency measurements.,"The study employs a modified effective chiral model with an isospin-dependent Lagrangian involving nucleons, hyperons, \(\Delta\) baryons, and mesons (\(\pi\), \(\sigma\), \(\rho\), \(\omega\)). The model includes mesonic cross-couplings (e.g., \(\sigma\)-\(\rho\) coupling parameterized by \(\eta_{1}\)) and spontaneous symmetry breaking, defining baryon and meson masses. Equations of state (EoSs) for hyperon-rich (\(H\)) and \(\Delta\)-matter are computed under charge neutrality and chemical equilibrium. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations solve for NS structure, while the Cowling approximation analyzes non-radial \(f\)-mode oscillations. Eigen frequencies \(\omega\) are determined via Ridders’s method, and tidal deformability \(\Lambda\) is calculated using Love numbers \(k_{2}\). Empirical relations link \(f\)-mode frequencies to mass, radius, and \(\Lambda\).","The \(\Delta\) EoS is stiffer than the \(H\) EoS, exceeding the conformal speed of sound limit \(c_s^2=1/3\) beyond \(2\rho_0\). Maximum NS masses are \(2.03 M_{\odot}\) (\(H\) EoS) and \(2.20 M_{\odot}\) (\(\Delta\) EoS), with radii of 12.11 km and 12.26 km, respectively. For \(1.4 M_{\odot}\) NSs, radii are 13.38 km (\(H\)) and 13.31 km (\(\Delta\)), consistent with NICER and GW170817 data. \(f\)-mode frequencies for \(l=2,3,4\) modes range from 1.84–2.42 kHz, 2.24–3 kHz, and 2.56–3.43 kHz, with higher frequencies for the stiffer \(\Delta\) EoS. Tidal deformability \(\Lambda_{1.4} \sim 800\) aligns with GW190814 constraints. The Love number \(k_{2}\) peaks at 0.137 for \(M \sim 0.9 M_{\odot}\) and decreases to 0.042 (\(H\)) and 0.036 (\(\Delta\)) at maximum mass. A linear fit \(f(\mathrm{kHz}) \approx 1.148 + 1.358 \sqrt{\tilde{M}/\tilde{R}^{3}}\) links \(f\)-modes to NS structure.","The stiffness of the \(\Delta\) EoS arises from stronger couplings (\(x_{\sigma \Delta}=x_{\rho \Delta}=x_{\omega \Delta}=1.2\)) and delayed appearance of \(\Delta\) baryons compared to hyperons. Hyperons soften the EoS by constituting a larger fraction of matter at lower densities. Violations of the conformal limit \(c_s^2=1/3\) in the \(\Delta\) EoS indicate strong interactions, while the \(H\) EoS approaches this limit. Higher compactness (\(C_{\max}=0.266\)) and surface redshift (\(Z_s^{\max}=0.462\)) for the \(\Delta\) EoS reflect its stiffness. Minimal impact of coupling constant variations on maximum mass and \(f\)-mode frequencies suggests robustness in the model.","The results validate the modified chiral model for describing NSs with exotic matter, aligning with pulsar and GW observational constraints. Future GW detections from binary NS mergers will refine EoS constraints and enhance understanding of \(f\)-mode oscillations. The empirical relations derived here provide a tool to infer NS properties from \(f\)-mode measurements, bridging theoretical models and observational data. The study underscores the importance of exotic baryons in shaping NS structure and GW signatures."
2502.03977,Performance Analysis of Digital Flux-locked Loop Circuit with Different SQUID \(V-\phi\) Transfer Curves for TES Readout System,Nan Li et al.,"Superconducting transition-edge sensors (TES) are ultra-low-noise detectors with energy resolution in the range of several to tens of \(\mathrm{eV}\). To achieve high signal-to-noise ratios, TES signals are typically coupled with low-noise direct current superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). However, SQUIDs are inherently nonlinear, necessitating a flux-locked loop (FLL) to enable linear amplification over a larger dynamic range. Digital FLL systems offer advantages such as simplified signal manipulation and increased dynamic range through flux-quanta counting and dynamic field compensation methods. These systems are widely used in applications like magnetoencephalogram (MEG), magnetocardiogram (MCG), and cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments.","Despite their widespread use, detailed analyses of parameters affecting digital FLL performance, such as bandwidth and slew rate, are limited. This work investigates the impact of SQUID \(V-\phi\) curve shapes on digital FLL performance, aiming to provide a reliable model for designing digital flux negative feedback and multiplexing SQUID readout systems.","The SQUID-FLL circuit comprises a single-stage SQUID where the TES current is coupled to the input coil \(L_{in}\), converting it into a magnetic flux signal \(\phi_{in}\). The SQUID’s response is modeled as a sinusoidal function:  
\[
u_{err}(t)=A \sin \left(\frac{2 \pi}{\phi_{0}}\left[i_{in}(t) M_{in}-\frac{u_{o}(t) M_{fb}}{R_{fb}}+\phi_{offset}\right]\right) G_{1}+u_{offset}
\]  
The digital FLL operates via a closed-loop negative flux feedback circuit with a PID algorithm:  
\[
u_{o}(n)=\left(\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}+\frac{C_{1}}{C_{2}}\right) u_{err}(n)+\frac{\Delta t}{R_{1} C_{2}} \sum_{i=0}^{n} u_{err}(i)+\frac{R_{2} C_{1}}{\Delta t}\left[u_{err}(n)-u_{err}(n-1)\right]
\]  
Simulations emulated laboratory conditions, using a 23 Hz triangle wave input, 150 MSPS sampling rate, and 7 samples per frame. Locking conditions, bandwidth, slew rate, and noise contributions were analyzed. System bandwidth was derived as:  
\[
f_{c} \approx \frac{V_{\phi} G_{1} M_{f b}}{2 \pi R_{1} C_{2} R_{f b}}
\]  
and adjusted for system delay:  
\[
f_{c} \approx \frac{V_{\phi} G_{1} M_{f b} N_{s p} t_{s p}}{2 \pi R_{1} C_{2} R_{f b} t_{f m}}
\]  
Slew rate was calculated as:  
\[
\frac{\partial \phi_{f b}}{\partial t}=\frac{\phi_{l i n} N_{s p} t_{s p}}{2 R_{1} C_{2} t_{f m}}
\]","Simulations showed absolute error signals below \(10 \mu \phi_{0}\) and relative errors under 0.1\% under locking conditions. Bandwidth for \(C_{2}=2 \mathrm{nF}\) was 628 kHz, consistent with theoretical predictions. The slew rate was \(1.5 \phi_{0}/\mu \mathrm{s}\), with distortion occurring for signal rise times exceeding \(1.6 \mu \mathrm{s}\). Noise analysis revealed ADC/DAC quantization noise contributions of \(0.8 \mathrm{pA}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}\) (16-bit ADC) and \(0.6 \mathrm{pA}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}\) (16-bit DAC), significantly lower than TES noise. The system tracked X-ray pulses with rise times from \(4.4 \mu \mathrm{s}\) to \(281 \mu \mathrm{s}\), but distortion occurred at amplitudes exceeding \(7.8 \phi_{0}\).","The FLL design was shown to be independent of SQUID \(V-\phi\) curve shapes, validated through simulations of three transfer function models. Bandwidth and slew rate depend on parameters like feedback capacitance, preamp gain, and integration time. System stability requires careful PID calibration to avoid oscillations. The delay-adjusted bandwidth formula and slew rate equation provide accurate performance predictions.","This work offers a reliable framework for designing high-performance digital PID flux feedback and multiplexing readout systems. Recommendations include using high-resolution ADC/DAC components (≥16 bits) and large feedback resistors to minimize noise. Adjusting integration parameters or feedback resistance can enhance bandwidth and slew rate, critical for applications requiring high-fidelity signal tracking, such as X-ray spectroscopy or CMB experiments."
2502.04319,On the origin of the \(\Sigma_{1}\),A. Cattaneo et al.,"Galaxies quench when the central black hole's energy output exceeds 100 times the baryonic gravitational binding energy. The central kiloparsec stellar surface density \(\Sigma_{1}\) acts as a morphological indicator, with galaxies reddening as \(\Sigma_{1}\) increases until they cross the quenching boundary \(\Sigma_{1} \propto M_{\star}^{0.66}\). Mergers drive supermassive black hole growth and morphological evolution, leading to high-mass passive galaxies, while lower-mass passives are mainly satellites quenched by environmental effects. The GalICS 2.2 semi-analytic model validated this scenario, reproducing observed galaxy mass functions and morphological properties. This work extends the analysis to include disc and bulge radii, closing the loop by showing the model reproduces Chen et al.’s \(\Sigma_{1}-M_{\star}\) boundary and exploring the astrophysical origin of the \(M_{\bullet}-\Sigma_{1}\) correlation.","The study aims to explain the empirical quenching boundary \(\Sigma_{1} \propto M_{\star}^{0.66}\), which links black hole mass \(M_{\bullet}\) to halo virial mass \(M_{\text{vir}}\) and velocity \(v_{\text{vir}}\). It seeks to establish \(\Sigma_{1}\) as a morphological indicator tied to bulge formation and black hole growth, distinguishing star-forming spirals (low \(\Sigma_{1}\)) from passive ellipticals (high \(\Sigma_{1}\)). The work also addresses the roles of mergers in driving quenching and environmental effects in satellite galaxy evolution.","The GalICS 2.2 semi-analytic model incorporates quenching via black hole feedback (Model B) and morphological transformations using a merger model (Model 2) that allows continuous transitions between major and minor mergers. Energy conservation and the virial theorem are applied to determine bulge properties during mergers, with energy contributions from merging galaxies' bulges and discs. Stellar and dark matter interactions are analyzed using GalMer simulations, revealing energy transfer efficiencies. Dissipationless mergers assume \(2 T_{*} /|U_{*}|=1\), introducing ~20% errors deemed negligible. Star formation timescales distinguish quiescent discs (1 Gyr) from bursty cusp/bar regions (0.24 Gyr), with SFR following \(\mathrm{SFR}=\epsilon_{\mathrm{sf}} M_{\mathrm{gas}} / t_{\mathrm{dyn}}\) and \(\epsilon_{\text{sf}} \sim 1 / 25\). Tidal stripping is modeled via tidal radius \(r_{\mathrm{t}}\), with corrections for NFW profiles improving satellite mass estimates. The model uses redshift-dependent sSFR thresholds from CANDELS to classify star-forming and passive galaxies.","GalICS 2.3 reproduces galaxy mass functions at \(0.5<z<2.5\), aligning with CANDELS and SDSS data. Star-forming galaxies lie within \(\pm 0.45\) dex of the main sequence, while passive galaxies show an upturn at low \(M_{\star}\) due to BH quenching (high-mass centrals) and environmental strangulation (low-mass satellites). Quenched galaxies with residual star formation exhibit lower \(\Sigma_{1}\) than passive galaxies, with \(\Sigma_{1}\) increasing as star formation fades. At \(z=0.05\), quenched galaxies match SDSS/ZENS \(\Sigma_{1}-M_{\star}\) relations, while star-forming galaxies follow steeper trends. The model predicts unobserved \(M_{\star} \sim 10^{12} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\) star-forming galaxies, possibly due to orphan subhaloes. Dissipationless mergers better reproduce mass-size relations across \(0<z<2.5\), though dissipative models improve agreement at \(z>1.5\).","The \(\Sigma_{1}-M_{\star}\) quenching boundary emerges naturally from the link between black hole growth and halo virial properties. Mergers drive morphological evolution, increasing \(\Sigma_{1}\) until galaxies cross the quenching threshold. A critical bulge-to-total ratio \(B/T \sim 0.3-0.5\) separates star-forming and passive populations. Post-quenching mergers further elevate \(B/T\), explaining color stratification in passive galaxies. Quenched star-forming galaxies (\(M_{\star}=10^{10.6 \pm 0.3} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\)) retain residual star formation from gas-rich mergers reactivating star formation. The model underestimates passive galaxies at \(M_{\star} \sim 10^{10} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\), suggesting unresolved environmental effects.","The study establishes a unified framework where BH feedback quenches high-mass centrals, while environmental effects dominate for low-mass satellites. Morphological indicators like \(\Sigma_{1}\) and \(B/T\) provide observable signatures of quenching pathways. The robustness of GalICS 2.3’s predictions across redshifts validates semi-analytic approaches for linking black hole physics to galaxy evolution. Systematic discrepancies at low \(z\) highlight uncertainties in stellar population models and light profile fitting. The findings underscore the importance of mergers in shaping galaxy demographics and the need for improved treatments of gas dissipation and environmental quenching in models."
2502.04108,Can a secluded self-interacting dark sector generate detectable gravitational waves?,Song Li et al.,"This study investigates a secluded, self-interacting dark sector where dark matter (DM) interactions address small-scale structure issues. The dark sector features a spontaneously broken \(U(1)^{\prime}\) gauge symmetry mediated by a dark Higgs mechanism, generating nearly massless dark radiation (DR) to avoid over-closure. The model includes DM (\(\chi\)), DR (\(\psi\)), and a dark photon (\(A^{\prime}\)), with thermal evolution governed by interactions and phase transitions. Cosmological constraints from the effective number of neutrinos (\(N_{\text{eff}}\)) and Lyman-α observations strongly limit the parameter space.",The research aims to determine whether gravitational waves (GWs) from a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in this dark sector could be detected by future observatories like SKA or LISA. The secluded nature of the dark sector (minimal interaction with the visible sector) and self-interacting DM properties are explored to resolve discrepancies in small-scale structure formation while adhering to cosmological bounds.,"The model employs a \(U(1)^{\prime}\)-gauged dark sector with a Lagrangian \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{Dark}}\) containing DM (\(\chi\)), dark Higgs (\(S\)), and DR (\(\psi\)). Symmetry breaking via \(S\) generates masses for \(\psi\), \(S\), and \(A^{\prime}\). The scalar potential \(V(S, \psi)\) ensures \(m_{\psi}^2 \ll (0.1 \text{eV})^2\), maintaining DR status. Key parameters include \(m_{\chi}\), \(m_{A^{\prime}}\), \(m_{s}\), and \(g^{\prime}\), constrained by small-scale structure data and FOPT dynamics. The dark sector thermalizes at high temperatures, with DM freeze-out via \(\chi \bar{\chi} \rightarrow A^{\prime} A^{\prime}\). A FOPT at the MeV scale produces stochastic GWs, with bubble collisions, sound waves, and turbulence contributing to the GW spectrum \(h^{2} \Omega_{\mathrm{GW}}(f)\). Parameter scans over \(\{m_{\chi}, m_{A^{\prime}}, \alpha^{\prime}, m_{s}, \xi_{\text{reh}}\}\) evaluate viability under \(N_{\text{eff}}\), Lyman-α, and DM self-interaction constraints.","Parameter space scans reveal stringent limits from \(\Delta N_{\text{eff}} = \frac{8}{7} \left(\frac{4}{11}\right)^{-4/3} \xi_{\infty}^4\) (constrained to \(\Delta N_{\text{eff}} < 0.29\) by Planck + BAO) and dark acoustic oscillations (DAO) from DM-DR scattering (\(a_{\text{dark}} < 30 \xi_{\infty}^{-4} \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\)). DM self-interaction cross-sections \(\bar{\sigma} / m_{\chi}\) vary with velocity, requiring \(\mathcal{O}(10)-\mathcal{O}(100) \text{ cm}^2/\text{g}\) for dwarf galaxies but \(<1 \text{ cm}^2/\text{g}\) for clusters. GW amplitudes \(h^{2} \Omega_{\mathrm{GW}}^{\text{peak}}\) reach up to \(10^{-7}\) in unconstrained regions but are suppressed by four orders of magnitude due to \(\Delta N_{\text{eff}}\) and DAO bounds.","The secluded self-interacting dark sector successfully addresses small-scale structure anomalies but faces severe limitations from cosmological observables. GW signals from FOPTs are predominantly undetectable by SKA or LISA under current constraints, as phase transition dynamics and dark sector reheating (\(\xi_{\infty}\) evolution) heavily suppress GW amplitudes.","The results underscore the challenge of probing secluded dark sectors via GWs or traditional methods. Even with strong DM self-interactions resolving astrophysical discrepancies, cosmological bounds on DR and DM-DR scattering render GW detection unlikely. Future work must address theoretical uncertainties in GW calculations and explore alternative detection strategies for such scenarios."
2502.03831,Optimizing Bayesian model selection for equation of state of cold neutron stars,Rahul Kashyap et al.,"Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy enables probing neutron star (NS) core matter via tidal deformability \(\Lambda\), linked to the equation of state (EOS) through the \(\mathrm{p}-\epsilon\) and \(\Lambda-\mathrm{m}\) relations. Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers imprint masses and tidal deformabilities in GW signals, extractable via Bayesian inference from waveform models calibrated to numerical relativity. Current detectors like LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA focus on compact binary coalescences, while next-generation detectors (Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer) aim to enhance sensitivity for refined NS property studies. Nonparametric inference methods dissociate macroscopic mass-radius relations from microscopic EOS details, as demonstrated in GW170817. Joint analyses of NICER and LIGO/Virgo measurements further constrain the dense matter EOS, with multi-messenger observations (e.g., X-ray data from millisecond pulsars) providing additional insights into neutron-rich matter and QCD phase transitions.","Noise and priors in GW data analysis introduce biases, necessitating multi-event analyses for robust EOS determination. Existing approaches face challenges in minimizing uncertainties and maximizing selection efficiency. The need for a framework that leverages GW data to dissociate macroscopic \(\mathrm{m}-\Lambda\) information from microscopic \(\mathrm{p}-\epsilon\) details motivates the development of BEOMS. This Bayesian model selection framework addresses degeneracies in parameter spaces, computational inefficiencies, and biases arising from phenomenological EOS parameterizations.","The BEOMS framework evaluates EOS models in \(\mathrm{m}-\Lambda\) space using EOS-agnostic parameter estimation (PE) results from BNS mergers. Evidence calculations start from the marginalized 4D posterior \(\mathrm{p}(\mathrm{m}_1, \Lambda_1, \mathrm{m}_2, \Lambda_2)\), transformed and marginalized to 2D/3D spaces for efficiency. Bayesian evidence \(\mathrm{Z}_{\mathrm{k}}\) for EOS hypotheses integrates over constrained parameter spaces, excluding samples beyond EOS maximum mass. Transformations to \(\tilde{\Lambda}\)-\(\delta\tilde{\Lambda}\) space fix chirp mass \(\mathcal{M}\), while \(\mathrm{m}_1\)-\(\Lambda_1\) and \(\mathrm{m}_2\)-\(\Lambda_2\) subspaces assume statistical independence. PE uses relative binning in Bilby with simulated BNS signals (IMRPhenomPv2_NRTidalv2), component masses sampled from double Gaussian distributions (\(\mu=1.35\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\), \(\sigma=0.08\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\); \(\mu=1.8\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\), \(\sigma=0.3\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\)), and uniform priors for spins, distances, and tidal deformabilities.","PE runs for 100 BNS events per EOS (APR4, DD2, SLy) show detector networks (O5, A\#, ECC) improving sensitivity: O5 detects 70/100 events, A\# detects 88, and ECC detects all 100. ECC achieves \(\sim\)100-fold higher SNR than O5, enhancing chirp mass precision by 100-fold. Evidence distributions for injected EOS models (DD2, APR4, SLy) show higher mean evidence in zero-noise scenarios, though realistic noise and low SNR skew results. Cumulative evidence from multiple events asymptotically favors the injected EOS, with ECC requiring the fewest events for distinguishability. Subspace evidence (\(Z_{m-\Lambda}\)) outperforms 4D calculations, reducing Occam’s penalty. For LIGO events (GW170817, GW190425), current sensitivity necessitates \(\sim\)20 events for reliable differentiation.","BEOMS validates its robustness through injection studies, demonstrating that evidence increases with \(\mathrm{L}_{2}\) distance between EOSs. The framework’s efficiency depends on BNS mass distributions, with fiducial NS mass distributions potentially skewing results for overlapping EOSs. Ignoring pairwise correlations between \(\mathrm{p}(\mathrm{m}_1, \Lambda_1)\) and \(\mathrm{p}(\mathrm{m}_2, \Lambda_2)\) improves model selection by mitigating Occam’s penalty. The cumulative Bayes factor matrix reveals that diagonal terms dominate as events accumulate, ensuring correct EOS identification.","BEOMS enhances EOS model selection for future GW detectors, particularly next-gen networks like ECC, which offer \(\mathcal{O}(10)-\mathcal{O}(100)\) sensitivity improvements. Subspace evidence calculations are recommended to balance efficiency and accuracy, though population-informed adjustments are needed for overlapping EOSs. Future work will address eccentricity, spin effects, waveform uncertainties, and multi-messenger integration. Advances in Bayesian tools (e.g., Bilby) and relative binning will refine NS EOS constraints, bridging GW and electromagnetic observations to advance dense matter physics."
2502.03983,Time delay interferometry with minimal null frequencies and shortened time span,Gang Wang,"Time delay interferometry (TDI) is crucial for space-based gravitational wave detectors like LISA, TAIJI, and TianQian to suppress laser noise. Second-generation TDI configurations, such as Michelson, address dynamic spacecraft motions but face limitations in noise suppression and data analysis. Previous work introduced the hybrid Relay configuration, which minimizes null frequencies but requires a long delay of \(7L\).","The hybrid Relay configuration’s long delay of \(7L\) poses practical challenges. This paper proposes PD4L, a novel TDI configuration with a reduced delay of \(3L\), offering advantages such as minimized null frequencies, reduced frequency aliasing, shorter signal tails, and improved parameter estimation accuracy for high-frequency gravitational waves. PD4L’s stable noise spectra and enhanced performance make it a promising candidate for future missions.","The PD4L configuration combines first-generation TDI configurations Beacon and Monitor, reducing the time span to \(4L\). Its observables, including the null stream, exhibit minimal null frequencies at \(m/L\) (\(m=1,2,3,...\)). Orthogonal transformations are applied when the real part of the cross spectral density (CSD) dominates, yielding science channels \(A\) and \(E\) for gravitational wave detection and \(T\) as a null stream. Additional null streams like \(C_{3}^{12}\) (time span \(2L\)) characterize instrumental noise. Noise spectra analyses include acceleration and optical metrology system (OMS) noise budgets:  
\[
\begin{aligned}

Parameter inference uses Bayesian methods on simulated data from a merging massive black hole binary (MBBH) with redshifted chirp mass \(\mathcal{M}_c\), mass ratio \(q\), and time shift \(\Delta t_c\). Laser and clock noise suppression is evaluated, assuming laser stability of \(30 \mathrm{~Hz} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}\), clock noise modeled as \(4 \times 10^{-27} / f\), and ranging errors with a bias of \(3 \mathrm{~ns}\). Software tools include NumPy, SciPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and GetDist.","PD4L’s null stream \(\mathrm{T}_{\text{PD4L}}\) and \(C_{3}^{12}\) exhibit the fewest null frequencies, ensuring stable noise spectra. PD4L’s shorter time span reduces noise power spectral densities (PSDs) at low frequencies but increases sensitivity to arm length changes. The sky-averaged gravitational wave response \(\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{TDI}}(f)\) shows PD4L suppresses signals at \(u<0.1\) but matches Michelson and hybrid Relay in sensitivity due to lower noise PSD. For a MBBH signal (\(m_{1}=3 \times 10^{4} M_{\odot}\), \(m_{2}=1 \times 10^{4} M_{\odot}\), \(z=0.2\)), PD4L reduces margin effects, frequency aliasing, and tail effects, yielding smoother waveforms. Parameter inference places true values within \(2\sigma\) for PD4L, with Gaussian-like marginalized distributions. Noise characterization captures acceleration noise parameters within \(2\sigma\) for 120–180-day durations but struggles with OMS noise for longer spans.","PD4L’s minimized null frequencies enhance phase coherence and high-frequency signal processing. Its shorter span mitigates waveform distortions and aliasing, favoring frequency-domain modeling. The null stream \(\mathrm{T}_{\text{PD4L}}\) is the most stable, outperforming \(C_{3}^{12}\) in amplitude and robustness. While PD4L suppresses gravitational waves and noise more strongly at low frequencies, its high-frequency performance offsets these limitations.","PD4L’s reduced time span and stable null streams make it a viable alternative for future space-based detectors, particularly for high-frequency gravitational wave analysis. Its advantages in mitigating tail effects and aliasing simplify signal modeling, though trade-offs exist in low-frequency suppression and noise spectrum stability. Future work will explore correlations between PD4L and other configurations to optimize noise characterization and gravitational wave detection."
2502.03759,Drone Beam Mapping of the TONE Radio Dish Array,Emily R. Kuhn et al.,"Drone-based beam calibration offers a novel solution for precise 21 cm cosmology telescope calibration, addressing challenges in foreground removal and beam pattern mapping. The TONE array, a CHIME/FRB outrigger pathfinder, consists of eight 6 m dishes operating at 400–800 MHz, instrumented with CHIME or HIRAX feeds. Traditional calibration methods face difficulties in achieving high-resolution beam maps and polarization leakage characterization.","The motivation is to develop a drone-based system for 400–800 MHz radio observatories that enables precise beam mapping, polarization alignment analysis, and RFI mitigation. This system aims to overcome limitations in existing calibration techniques by providing 2D high-resolution co- and cross-polarized beam maps, essential for understanding beam pattern distortions and polarization leakage in 21 cm cosmology experiments.","The drone calibration system employs a DJI Matrice 600 Pro equipped with a 400–800 MHz broadband calibration payload, including a noise source, RF switch, and biconical antenna. Positional accuracy is enhanced by an RTK ground station, achieving 20–30 minute flights at ~200 m altitude. Flight plans are executed via UgCS software, with telemetry data processed using DatCon. The payload generates a switched calibration signal (400 ms pulsed white-noise with 50% duty cycle), enabling background subtraction with a 200 ms cadence. A UBlox RTK GPS ensures timing synchronization, while a 95 dB ENR noise source attenuated to 49–59 dB provides dynamic range for the TONE correlator.","Data processing involves identifying the pulsed calibration signal, applying timing corrections via 2D Gaussian fitting, gridding data into Cartesian or polar coordinates, and normalizing sidelobe and main beam flights. Background subtraction uses rolling averages of 20 background points to mitigate slow RFI and gain drifts. Timing offsets up to 4.5 s are corrected by maximizing Pearson-R correlation. Gaussian fits \(G(x, y) = A e^{-\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\sigma_x^2} - \frac{(y-y_0)^2}{2\sigma_y^2}} + C\) center beam maps, with radial distance corrections \(\left(r(t)/r_0\right)^2\) applied for \(1/r^2\) brightness drop-off. Normalization scales non-reference flights to a reference flight (e.g., flight 618 for North polarization) using annulus regions.","Twelve analyzed flights (out of 48) included main beam (100 m width) and sidelobe (200 m width) measurements, with grid spacing optimized for battery life. Front-end filters mitigated RFI from the drone’s communication signals. The ICEboard FPGA system digitized and correlated signals into 1024 frequency bins at 400–800 MHz, with 42 ms integration for high SNR.","# Results  
Drone measurements of four TONE dishes revealed co-polarized beam patterns with first and second sidelobes at ~12° (-20 dB) and ~25° (-25 dB), respectively. Statistical errors were 7–9% (main beam), 9% (first sidelobe), and ~70% (second sidelobe). Main beam FWHM decreased from 8.5° at 450 MHz to 6° at 600 MHz, differing from prior celestial calibration results. Cross-polarized amplitudes ranged from -23.5 dB to -12.5 dB relative to co-polarized peaks, with North-polarized inputs consistently higher than East-polarized."
2502.04212,The DESI 2024 hint for dynamical dark energy is biased by low-redshift supernovae,"Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) et al.","The \(\Lambda\)CDM model, despite its success, faces tensions such as the \(\sim 5 \sigma\) Hubble tension and \(\sim 3 \sigma S_{8}\) tension, hinting at possible new physics. The DESI collaboration’s recent findings, combined with DESY5 data, have reignited debates on dynamical dark energy (DE). While DESI baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and DESY5 alone align with \(\Lambda\)CDM, their joint analysis with Planck CMB suggests a \(3.9 \sigma\) preference for dynamical DE. The Carnegie Supernova Project, CfA surveys, and Foundation Supernova Survey enhance Type Ia supernova (SN) datasets for precision cosmology. Studies explore late-time or local-scale new physics to resolve the Hubble tension, alongside models like non-minimally coupled gravity and inhomogeneous interacting DE.","This study aims to determine whether the DESI collaboration’s reported preference for dynamical DE stems from new physics or systematics, particularly in the low-redshift SN (low-\(z\) SN) sample within DESY5. Inconsistencies between DES measurements and previous datasets (e.g., SDSS BAO, PantheonPlus) raise concerns about potential calibration errors or sample selection biases in low-\(z\) SNe. Resolving this is critical to validate claims of dynamical DE.","The analysis combines DESI BAO, DESY5, SDSS eBOSS BAO, PantheonPlus, and Planck CMB data. Standardized apparent magnitudes \(m_{B}^{\text{corr}}\) are used to detect systematics in the low-\(z\) SN sample. A likelihood function based on distance moduli residuals is defined, and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) constraints are applied to the \(w_{0}w_{a}\)CDM model. Magnitude-redshift relations for low-\(z\) and DES-SN samples are reconstructed, focusing on the intercept \(-5a_{B}\), a systematic-sensitive parameter expected to remain stable within a single SN compilation.","A \(\sim 0.043\) magnitude discrepancy in \(-5a_{B}\) is identified between low-\(z\) and DES-SN samples, unrelated to \(\Omega_{m}\) values and ruling out local-scale effects. This inconsistency arises abruptly around \(z \sim 0.1\). Excluding the low-\(z\) sample reduces the preference for dynamical DE from \(\sim 3.9 \sigma\) to \(<2 \sigma\). DESI BAO measurements alone deviate from Planck-\(\Lambda\)CDM predictions, particularly in the LRG2 sample (\(0.6 < z < 0.8\)), hinting at dynamical DE or modified gravity. Correcting the \(-5a_{B}\) discrepancy via magnitude adjustments or sample exclusion similarly reduces the significance to \(\sim 1.6 \sigma\).","The \(\sim 0.043\) magnitude discrepancy in \(-5a_{B}\) indicates systematics in the multi-sample mixed low-\(z\) SNE, likely due to calibration errors or incorrect sample selection. DES-SN exhibits stable \(a_{B}\) distributions aligned with Planck-\(\Lambda\)CDM, while low-\(z\) SNe show irregular fluctuations. These systematics artificially amplify the preference for dynamical DE. DESI BAO deviations in the LRG2 sample remain intriguing but inconclusive, as current data cannot distinguish between dynamical DE and modified gravity.","The DESI result is likely a mirage caused by low-\(z\) SN systematics rather than new physics. Correcting these systematics aligns observations with \(\Lambda\)CDM, reducing the dynamical DE preference to \(<2 \sigma\). This underscores the need for rigorous scrutiny of SN calibration and sample homogeneity in future surveys. While DESI BAO deviations warrant further investigation, current evidence does not decisively challenge the standard cosmological model. Addressing SN systematics will be pivotal for resolving cosmological tensions and validating DE evolution claims."
2502.03973,Axisymmetric stability of neutron stars as extreme rotators in massive scalar-tensor theory,Alan Tsz-Lok Lam et al.,"The upcoming fifth observing run (expected in 2027) of the international gravitational wave (GW) network aims to detect more binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, particularly in the high-frequency band \(\gtrsim 10^{3} \mathrm{~Hz}\), enhancing post-merger waveform resolution. These waveforms provide insights into hypermassive neutron stars (HMNSs), which are supported by differential rotation, thermal pressure, and magnetic forces, carrying information about the nuclear equation of state (EOS) and gravitational theories. Scalar-tensor theories, such as Damour-Esposito-Farese (DEF) theory, offer alternatives to general relativity (GR), with constraints on the scalar field mass \(m_{\phi}\) from pulsar timing and GW observations. Recent studies have identified stationary, axisymmetric scalarized neutron stars (NSs) with angular momenta exceeding GR limits, resembling HMNSs from BNS mergers. These super-rotating NSs challenge stability criteria, prompting the extension of the turning-point criterion—used for secular instabilities in uniformly rotating NSs—to differentially rotating scalarized NSs.","The primary question is whether scalarized NSs with ultra-high angular momenta, potentially formed in BNS mergers, are dynamically stable. This work investigates their stability through axisymmetric numerical relativity simulations, assessing perturbations and validating the turning-point criterion for differentially rotating NSs in scalar-tensor gravity. The criterion identifies instability onset via extremal points of the gravitational mass \(M_{G}\) as a function of central energy density \(\epsilon_{c}\). The results aim to determine if scalarized NS mergers can produce ultra-highly rotating remnants, offering insights into HMNS stability and dynamics in scalar-tensor gravity.","The Jordan frame action of DEF theory is  
\[
S= \frac{1}{16 \pi} \int d^{4} x \sqrt{-g}\left[\phi \mathcal{R}-\frac{\omega(\phi)}{\phi} \nabla_{a} \phi \nabla^{a} \phi-U(\phi)\right] -S_{\text {matter }},  
\]  
with \(\omega(\phi) = B \ln \phi\) and \(U(\phi) = \frac{2 m_{\phi}^{2} \varphi^{2} \phi^{2}}{B}\). The Einstein frame simplifies the potential to \(V=m_{\phi}^{2} \bar{\varphi}^{2} /(2 B)\). A modified RNS code constructs equilibrium scalarized NS models using a KEH scheme in quasi-isotropic coordinates:  
\[
d s^{2} = -e^{\eta+\sigma} d t^{2} + e^{\eta-\sigma} r^{2} \sin ^{2} \theta\left(d \phi^{2}-\varpi d t\right)^{2} + e^{2 \tau}\left(d r^{2}+r^{2} d \theta^{2}\right).

\[

\]  
governs angular momentum \(J = \int_{r<R_{\star}} \alpha \rho h F \sqrt{\gamma} d^{3} x\). Axisymmetric numerical relativity simulations employ the BSSN formalism with moving puncture gauge, cartoon method, 9 refinement levels, 6th-order finite differences, and HLLC Riemann solver. Parameters include scalar mass \(m_{\phi}\), angular momentum \(J\), and central energy density \(\epsilon_{\text{thre}}\), focusing on the MPA1 EOS.","For massless scalar fields, turning points were identified in sequences with \(J=8\), \(12\), and \(20\), but not \(J=40\). Stability assessments showed marginally stable models near mass maxima; \(J=40\) models remained stable. Stable models exhibited damping of density perturbations and scalar field oscillations within dynamical timescales, while unstable models collapsed into black holes with scalar field dissipation. For massive scalars (\(m_{\phi} = 0.01\)), sequences with \(J=8\) and \(12\) had turning points, while \(J=20\) and \(30\) remained stable. Unstable models collapsed into black holes, with scalar fields decaying to \(\sim 10^{-3}\). Axisymmetric oscillation spectra for \(J=8\) revealed quasi-radial \(m=0\) fundamental and \(\phi\)-modes, with \(\phi\)-mode frequencies approaching the Yukawa cutoff \(f_c = \omega_\phi / (2\pi)\) near instability onset.","The turning-point criterion is validated for differentially rotating scalarized NSs in DEF theory, aligning with GR’s criterion for rigid rotation. Instability arises near turning points in constant-\(J\) sequences. For massless scalars, instability occurs when the \(\phi\)-mode reaches the Yukawa cutoff frequency, contrasting GR’s fundamental mode mechanism. Stable models preserve density, scalar profiles, and rotation laws over \(\gtrsim 15\) ms. Axisymmetric results exclude non-axisymmetric instabilities (e.g., bar-mode), necessitating 3D simulations to assess broader stability.","These findings provide insights into the dynamics of HMNS remnants in scalar-tensor gravity, particularly the stability of ultra-highly rotating scalarized NSs. The results highlight the role of scalar fields in altering instability mechanisms and emphasize the need for 3D simulations to explore non-axisymmetric instabilities. Validating the turning-point criterion in scalar-tensor gravity enhances the framework for interpreting GW signals from BNS mergers."

China","Tidal disruption events (TDEs), caused by stars being shredded by supermassive black holes (SMBHs), produce luminous transients with debated emission mechanisms. AT 2018dyk, initially classified as a TDE, was later debated as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) turn-on event. Recent analyses, including follow-up spectra and host-galaxy data, support its classification as a TDE occurring in a gas-rich environment, evidenced by mid-infrared (MIR) outbursts and Fe coronal lines. Comparisons with TDE-linked extreme coronal line emitters (TDE-ECLEs) and other TDEs reveal shared characteristics, including a MIR color-luminosity relationship in gas-rich environments. AT 2018dyk’s evolution aligns with TDE-ECLEs, exhibiting rapid spectral changes, strong Fe coronal lines, and MIR outbursts. A Hubble constant \(H_0 = 73 \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}\) is assumed.","The classification of AT 2018dyk as a TDE or AGN remains unresolved, necessitating multi-wavelength follow-up observations to distinguish its nature. Understanding its emission mechanisms and environmental context is critical for clarifying the connection between TDEs, TDE-ECLEs, and AGN variability, particularly in gas-rich environments where dust reprocessing and coronal line emission play significant roles.","Optical spectroscopy from DESI (2023), SDSS Legacy (2002), MaNGA (2017), Keck/LRIS, and FLOYDS (2018) was combined with photometry from ATLAS and ZTF. MIR data from AllWISE and NEOWISE-R were analyzed to study the transient’s behavior. Host galaxy properties, including stellar mass (\(11.02 \pm 0.02 \log_{10}(M_{\odot} \text{yr}^{-1})\)), Sérsic index (\(n = 2.20 \pm 0.01\)), and specific star-formation rate (\(-10.97 \pm 0.13 \log_{10}(\mathrm{yr}^{-1})\)), were derived. Emission line fitting, MIR variability analysis, and comparisons with coronal-line TDEs (CrL-TDEs), TDE-ECLEs, and AGN-ECLEs were performed. Power-law fits to MIR light curves and virial distance estimates from Fe coronal line FWHM velocities (640–1370 km s\(^{-1}\)) were conducted.","AT 2018dyk exhibited broad H, He, and Fe coronal lines post-outburst, with Fe lines emerging 19 days post-peak and persisting for 35–1819 days. MIR photometry revealed a delayed peak (~180 days) and color evolution (\(\Delta W1 = 0.40 \pm 0.01\) mag, \(\Delta W2 = 0.79 \pm 0.01\) mag, \(\Delta(W1-W2) = 0.39 \pm 0.01\) mag). The host galaxy, SDSS J1533+4432, showed LINER emission from evolved stars, a central stellar velocity dispersion of \(122.5 \pm 1.9 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\), and an SMBH mass of \(6.86 \pm 0.05 \log_{10}(\mathrm{M}_{\odot})\). DESI spectra >5 years post-peak indicated a return to pre-outburst states, but [O III] \(\lambda5007\) emission strengthened significantly. MIR power-law decline indices (\(-1.25 \pm 0.04\) in \(W1\), \(-1.02 \pm 0.03\) in \(W2\)) aligned with SMBH accretion models.","AT 2018dyk’s rapid spectral evolution, MIR outbursts, and Fe coronal lines support its classification as a TDE in a gas-rich environment. Layered gas structures near the SMBH, evidenced by coronal line widths and virial distances (0.02–0.97 pc), suggest X-ray reprocessing. The host’s ""retired galaxy"" classification and lack of AGN activity reinforce the TDE scenario. MIR color-luminosity trends and variability distinguish it from AGN-ECLEs, with dust reprocessing explaining flux excesses. The transient’s shorter MIR outburst duration and smaller amplitude compared to TDE-ECLEs imply lower gas density or covering factors near the SMBH.","AT 2018dyk reinforces the TDE-ECLE connection and highlights the role of MIR observations in classifying transients. The absence of recurrent flares and distinct MIR evolution from AGNs underscore the importance of long-term, multi-wavelength follow-up. The end of NEOWISE-R creates a gap in studying such systems, emphasizing the need for future MIR surveys. These findings advance understanding of TDEs in diverse environments and their interplay with SMBH accretion processes."
2502.04041,GrayHawk: A public code for calculating the Gray Body Factors of massless fields around spherically symmetric Black Holes,Marco Calzá,"Black holes are pivotal in understanding gravity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics, offering insights into fundamental physics. Recent discoveries, such as gravitational waves from binary mergers and images of supermassive black holes, have underscored their significance. Hawking's revelation that black holes emit quasi-thermal radiation has spurred extensive research into Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics. Modifications to general relativity, motivated by cosmological and quantum challenges, have introduced various black hole metrics, affecting observables like Hawking radiation. Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), formed in the early Universe, are intriguing as potential dark matter candidates due to their small size and high temperature, making their Hawking radiation a valuable probe into the Standard Model and beyond. The computation of Hawking radiation involves solving Schrödinger-like wave equations for perturbing fields, with gray-body factors (GBFs) critically modifying the radiation spectrum as it propagates from the horizon to infinity.","Semi-analytical methods for computing GBFs are limited by approximations, highlighting the need for precise numerical tools. This work introduces a numerical tool to compute GBFs for spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black holes, handling a range of perturbing fields and metrics. The tool aims to provide accurate results for emission spectra, black hole evolution, and studies of quantum properties, particularly for PBHs and modified gravity scenarios.","The code focuses on spherically symmetric, static, asymptotically flat metrics of the form \(ds^{2}=-G(r)dt^{2}+\frac{dr^{2}}{F(r)}+H(r)d\Omega^{2}\), encompassing Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, Hayward, Bardeen, Simpson-Visser, Peltola-Kunstatter, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli metrics. Using the Newman-Penrose formalism, massless field equations reduce to a master equation for NP-scalars \(\Upsilon_{s}\). Under the ansatz \(\Upsilon_{s}(t,r,\theta,\varphi)=\Phi_{s}(r)S_{l,m}^{s}(\theta,\varphi)e^{-i\omega t}\), the radial equation in tortoise coordinates \(dr^{*}/dr=1/\sqrt{FG}\) becomes \(\partial_{r^{*}}Z_{s}+(\omega^{2}+V_{s}(r(r^{*})))Z_{s}=0\). Boundary conditions yield asymptotic solutions, with transmission coefficient \(T=1/|b|^{2}\) representing the GBF \(\Gamma_{s}^{l}(\omega)\). The emission rate is \(\frac{d^{2}N_{i}}{dtdE_{i}}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sum_{l,m}\frac{n_{i}\Gamma_{l,m}^{s}(\omega)}{e^{\omega/T}\pm 1}\), where \(T\) is the black hole temperature.","The code GrayHawk.nb computes GBFs using numerical inversion of tortoise coordinates, sampling near-horizon and far-away regimes, and fitting asymptotic solutions. CalibratorGH.nb verifies sampling adequacy. Metrics include Schwarzschild (\(ds^{2}=-(1-2M/r)dt^{2}+\frac{dr^{2}}{1-2M/r}+r^{2}d\Omega^{2}\)), Reissner-Nordström (\(ds^{2}=-(1-2M/r+Q^{2}/r^{2})dt^{2}+\frac{dr^{2}}{1-2M/r+Q^{2}/r^{2}}+r^{2}d\Omega^{2}\)), Hayward (\(ds^{2}=\left(1-\frac{2Mr^{2}}{r^{3}+2M\ell^{2}}\right)dt^{2}+\frac{dr^{2}}{1-\frac{2Mr^{2}}{r^{3}+2M\ell^{2}}}+r^{2}d\Omega^{2}\)), Bardeen (\(ds^{2}=\left(1-\frac{2Mr^{2}}{(r^{2}+\ell^{2})^{3/2}}\right)dt^{2}+\frac{dr^{2}}{1-\frac{2Mr^{2}}{(r^{2}+\ell^{2})^{3/2}}}+r^{2}d\Omega^{2}\)), Simpson-Visser (\(ds^{2}=-\left(1-\frac{2M}{\sqrt{r^{2}+\ell^{2}}}\right)dt^{2}+\frac{dr^{2}}{1-\frac{2M}{\sqrt{r^{2}+\ell^{2}}}}+(r^{2}+\ell^{2})d\Omega^{2}\)), Peltola-Kunstatter (\(ds^{2}=-\left(\frac{r-2M}{\sqrt{r^{2}+\ell^{2}}}\right)dt^{2}+\frac{dr^{2}}{\frac{r-2M}{\sqrt{r^{2}+\ell^{2}}}}+(r^{2}+\ell^{2})d\Omega^{2}\)), and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli (\(ds^{2}=-\left(1-\frac{2M}{\sqrt{r^{2}+\ell^{2}}}\right)dt^{2}+\frac{dr^{2}}{\left(1-\frac{2M}{\sqrt{r^{2}+\ell^{2}}}\right)\left(1+\frac{\ell}{\sqrt{r^{2}+\ell^{2}}}\right)}+(r^{2}+\ell^{2})d\Omega^{2}\)). Modifications for new metrics, such as the Frolov BH (\(ds^{2}=\left(1-\frac{\left(2M-q^{2}\right)r^{2}}{r^{3}+2M\ell^{2}}\right)dt^{2}+\frac{dr^{2}}{1-\frac{\left(2M-q^{2}\right)r^{2}}{r^{3}+2M\ell^{2}}}+r^{2}d\Omega^{2}\)), involve adjusting parameters and sampling regions.","# Results  
Validation against literature spectra for Hayward, Bardeen, Simpson-Visser, Peltola-Kunstatter, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli black holes shows excellent agreement, with residuals at spectral peaks below 1%. Computational times range from 7–10 seconds for Schwarzschild to longer durations for complex metrics. GBFs are computed up to \(l=4\), with energy ranges from 0 to 1 (in units of \(M=1\)). CalibratorGH.nb ensures sampling adequacy, addressing non-oscillatory or growing oscillations in solutions. The Frolov BH example demonstrates successful adaptation of the code for custom metrics.","# Interpretation  
The tool’s accuracy in reproducing known spectra confirms its reliability for studying Hawking radiation across diverse black hole configurations. Precise GBF computation enables detailed modeling of emission spectra, critical for analyzing black hole evaporation, quantum gravity effects, and beyond-Standard-Model physics. The code’s flexibility to accommodate user-defined metrics enhances its utility in exploring modified gravity theories and regular black hole models."
2502.03830,Unveiling the emission properties of three long-period pulsars using FAST,H. M. Tedila et al.,"Pulsars, highly magnetized neutron stars, exhibit stable radio emissions but also intriguing variability like nulls, mode changes, bright pulses, and microstructures. Nulls, periods of diminished or absent emission, occur on timescales from single rotations to months, with null fractions ranging from 0% to 95%. These phenomena are linked to magnetospheric instabilities or plasma supply disruptions. Bright pulses, or giant pulses, represent intense flares from localized magnetospheric activity, while microstructures offer insights into pulsar emission dynamics. The FAST telescope has advanced pulsar studies, discovering over 180 new pulsars, including long-period ones like PSR J1900-0134, with notable magnetic fields and spin-down energy loss rates.","This paper explores the emission phenomena (nulls, dwarf pulses, bright pulses, and microstructures) in three long-period pulsars observed with FAST, aiming to understand their magnetospheric dynamics and implications for pulsar physics.","FAST, with a 300-meter aperture, observed long-period pulsars during the CRAFTS Survey using a 19-beam receiver (1.05–1.45 GHz) and ROACH2 processor. Data, with \(49.152 \mu \mathrm{s}\) time and 0.488 MHz frequency resolution, were processed offline using DSPSR and PSRCHIVE software. RFI was excised, and single-pulse sequences were averaged, baseline-subtracted, and organized into pulse stacks. Flux calibration employed the radiometer equation, yielding \(S_{\text{av}} \approx 3.5 \text{ mJy}\).","FAST observations of PSR J1945+1211, PSR J2323+1214, and PSR J1900-0134 reveal complex single-pulse behaviors, including burst pulses, bridge emission, quasi-periodic nulls, and intricate microstructures. Pulse energy distributions show bimodal patterns, with null fractions of \(52.46\% \pm 2.89\%\) (PSR J1945+1211), \(48.48\% \pm 2.51\%\) (PSR J2323+1214), and \(27.51\% \pm 1.37\%\) (PSR J1900-0134). PSR J2323+1214 exhibits asymmetrical nulling (\(61.34\% \pm 1.82\%\) in leading vs. \(50.27\% \pm 1.73\%\) in trailing components). Quasi-periodic null-burst transitions occur with periodicities of \(15.38 \pm 0.90\) periods (PSR J1945+1211) and \(22.22 \pm 2.4\) periods (PSR J2323+1214). Dwarf pulses (\(0.011\%\) of observations) in PSR J2323+1214 and bright pulses (\(>10\times\) average intensity) in all pulsars were detected. PSR J1900-0134 displayed 95 microstructure pulses with periodicities ranging from \(0.098\) to \(3.792\) ms. Burst pulses exhibited widths up to 498.9 ms (PSR J1945+1211) and fluences up to 282.500 Jy ms, highlighting emission variability.","The high null fractions and quasi-periodic transitions suggest magnetospheric instabilities linked to plasma generation disruptions. Asymmetric nulling and component-dependent emission profiles imply variations in magnetic field structure or viewing geometry. Microstructures and bright pulses reflect localized magnetospheric activity, while dwarf pulses indicate fragile emission mechanisms near the death line. Long-period pulsars exhibit wider pulse widths and more complex substructures than ordinary pulsars, attributed to slower rotation and dynamic magnetospheres.","These findings challenge traditional pulsar emission theories, particularly near the death line, where sustained radio emission persists despite low spin-down luminosities (\(<10^{31} \mathrm{erg/s}\)). Quasi-periodic nulls and microstructure periodicities suggest underlying magnetospheric carousel processes. The diversity of emission behaviors underscores the need for high-sensitivity observations to refine models of plasma dynamics and pulsar evolution."

The project, which achieved First Light in January 2024, involves 130,000 low-frequency antennas (50 MHz to 350 MHz) and 200 mid-frequency antennas (350 MHz to 15.5 GHz), producing raw data rates exceeding 10 Tb/s and requiring 100 Pflop/s computing power. SKAO’s operational demands include 99.9% availability, scalability, and reproducibility. The Observatory Management and Control (OMC) system employs Agile software development, leveraging Cloud Computing, DevOps, and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to reduce operational costs and carbon emissions. The phased construction schedule, involving Array Assemblies (AAs), integrates Agile software deployment to handle increasing data processing needs. Key milestones include AA0.5 (the first test array for interferometry) and AA2 (marking the start of science verification). The SKA’s software architecture emphasizes deployability, modifiability, and testability, aligning with industry best practices for efficient project delivery.","The complexity of SKAO’s software ecosystem necessitates scalable, resilient, and maintainable solutions. Agile methodologies and cloud-native principles are critical to managing distributed development teams, ensuring rapid iteration, and meeting stringent operational requirements. Lessons from observatories like ALMA, Vera Rubin, LOFAR, and GMRT highlight the need for standardized workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and containerization to address challenges in large-scale, multinational collaborations. The transition to a cloud-native Agile framework aims to reduce costs, improve reproducibility, and support long-term sustainability while harmonizing pre-construction experiences and enabling efficient integration of hardware and software components.","The SKAO employs the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe®), orchestrating software development through Agile Array Release Trains (ARTs) such as Observation Management and Control (OMC), Data Processor (DP), Services, and Integration ARTs. A cloud-native approach underpins development, with functionalities decomposed into microservices managed via GitLab CI/CD, Jira for issue tracking, and Kubernetes for container orchestration. The SKA Minimal Viable Product Integration (SKAMPI) served as a foundational toolset for Agile delivery, integrating components like the Telescope Manager (TM) and Central Signal Processor (CSP) via automated CI/CD frameworks. The EngageSKA cluster, hosted at the Institute of Telecommunications in Aveiro, provided a cloud-based platform for testing, featuring OpenStack and Kubernetes (syscore) for scalable resource allocation. Tango Controls, a distributed middleware leveraging CORBA and ZeroMQ, was adopted for hardware and software control, while Taranta offered a graphical interface for device monitoring. Centralized configuration using Ansible and libguestfs for volume migration streamlined resource management.","SKAMPI validated software correctness and enabled end-to-end functionality but faced challenges due to brittleness and lack of ownership, leading to its deprecation. EngageSKA supported development with 16 rack servers, including compute, storage, and GPU nodes, facilitating SKA Data Challenges and CI/CD pipelines. Resource management issues included instances consuming up to 8 CPUs, 16GB RAM, and ~1000GB volumes without ownership. Migration efforts reduced volume sizes from ~100GB to ~3GB using libguestfs. Tango and Taranta successfully enabled real-time monitoring, alarms, and forensic analysis across SKA teams. Prometheus, Thanos, and Grafana were implemented for performance monitoring, enhancing CI/CD efficiency.","SKAMPI’s deprecation underscored the need for robust ownership models and stable architectures in large-scale Agile projects. The EngageSKA cluster demonstrated the viability of cloud-native environments for insulating developers from hardware complexities, though resource management required centralized automation. Agile practices and standardized APIs improved portability, while lessons from ALMA and Vera Rubin informed SKAO’s transition to modular, service-oriented architectures. The adoption of green ICT trends, including containerization and DevOps, reduced operational costs and carbon footprints, aligning with sustainability goals.","The ENGAGE SKA platform established a collaborative framework for cloud-native Agile development, setting a precedent for large-scale observatories. Its emphasis on CI/CD, test automation, and end-to-end integration accelerates SKAO’s transition to a Lean Enterprise, ensuring scalability and maintainability. The project’s open-source tools and reference implementations lower barriers to entry for global collaborators, fostering innovation in ICT and radio astronomy. By integrating industrial best practices with astronomical requirements, SKAO’s software ecosystem enhances long-term operational resilience and adaptability to future technological advancements."

Both are expected to host \(1 \pm 1\) RR Lyrae based on empirical relations, making their study valuable for UFDs with \(M_V \gtrsim -5.0\) mag.",Studying RR Lyrae populations in UFDs like Aquarius III and Virgo III provides insights into their stellar populations and evolutionary histories. The empirical expectation of hosting \(1 \pm 1\) RR Lyrae in such systems motivates targeted searches to validate models and understand the demographics of variable stars in low-luminosity UFDs.,"Time-series observations of Aquarius III were conducted using the Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) from 06 November to 07 December 2024, collecting 64 \(r\)-band images with 600-second exposures. The median seeing was \(1.26^{\prime \prime}\), reaching a depth of \(r \sim 22.0\) mag. The Princeton Instruments SOPHIA 2048B CCD camera provided a \(13.1^{\prime} \times 13.1^{\prime}\) field-of-view (FOV). Detected sources were cross-matched with the SDSS DR16 catalog, and magnitudes were calibrated to the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) AB system. Archival data from the PS1 \(3 \pi\) RR Lyrae Catalog and Gaia DR3 RR Lyrae Catalog were used to search for RR Lyrae within \(16 r_h\) of Aquarius III. Synthetic color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) were generated using the BaSTI tool with \(\alpha\)-enhanced models, \(Y = 0.247\), a 13 Gyr age, \(-2.4\) dex metallicity, and the Kroupa initial mass function.","A candidate RR Lyrae (SDSS DR16 objID 1237679433443508701) was detected \(\sim 4 r_h\) from Aquarius III’s center but was \(\gtrsim 1\) mag fainter than expected. Combining LOT and archival data, it was identified as a background halo star at \(\sim 163\) kpc. Another ab-type RR Lyrae (PS1 ID 103753576326015348, Gaia DR3 ID 2447369809479339136) was found \(\sim 25^{\prime}\) (\(\sim 15.6 r_h\)) from Aquarius III’s center. Its proper motion \((\mu_{\alpha *}, \mu_{\delta}) = (0.923 \pm 0.637, -0.549 \pm 0.565)\) mas yr\(^{-1}\) and photometric metallicity (\(-2.38 \pm 0.39\) dex) align with Aquarius III’s properties. Period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relations yielded a distance of \(87.9 \pm 5.7\) kpc, consistent with Aquarius III’s distance (\(85 \pm 4\) kpc). Synthetic CMDs for UFDs with \(\sim 2000 M_{\odot}\) stellar mass showed a \(\sim 50\%\) probability of hosting at least one RR Lyrae.","The RR Lyrae Aquarius III-V1, with matching distance, proper motion, and metallicity, is the first confirmed variable star associated with Aquarius III. The background candidate’s exclusion demonstrates the importance of multi-band photometry and distance validation. Synthetic CMDs confirm that UFDs with \(M_V \gtrsim -5.0\) mag have a non-negligible probability of hosting RR Lyrae, supporting empirical predictions.","This study highlights the feasibility of identifying RR Lyrae in low-luminosity UFDs and underscores the need for wide-field surveys to account for extended stellar populations. The detection of Aquarius III-V1 encourages similar searches in newly discovered UFDs, advancing our understanding of their old stellar components and evolutionary pathways."
2502.04002,Nonextensive entropic behavior observed in Quasar 3C 273,C. V. da Silva et al.,"Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), such as Quasar 3C 273 (\(z=0.158\)), exhibit high variability across electromagnetic wavelengths. Emissions from 3C 273 involve synchrotron radiation and thermal processes: synchrotron flares dominate from radio to IR/optical bands, UV radiation may arise from clumping matter or an accretion disc, and X-rays are produced via Comptonization or inverse Compton processes. The Integral Science Data Centre (ISDC) database provides extensive multiwavelength data, enabling detailed variability studies of such systems.","Non-extensive statistical mechanics offers a framework to analyze the entropic behavior of quasars, a gap this study addresses by examining 3C 273's nonextensivity across wavelengths. The work aims to link Tsallis entropy (\(S_{q}\)) and \(q\)-indices to physical processes in AGNs, leveraging the ISDC's multiwavelength light curves to explore variability and energy-dependent entropy trends.","The study analyzes 39 light curves of 3C 273 from 1963 to 2005, covering radio (5–37 GHz), millimeter/submillimeter (0.8–3.3 mm), IR (1.25–3.6 \(\mu\)m), optical (3439–7000 Å), UV (1300–3000 Å), and X-ray (5–200 keV) bands. Data quality was ensured by including only flags 0 or +1. The Tsallis entropy framework, a generalization of Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) entropy, was employed to study nonextensive systems. Tsallis entropy is defined as \(S_{q} = k_{B} \frac{1-\sum_{i} P_{i}^{q}}{q-1}\), where \(q=1\) recovers BG entropy. The \(q\)-Gaussian distribution, \(P_{q}(y) = A_{q}[1+(q-1)(y/\sigma_{q})^{2}]^{1/(1-q)}\), models flux variations, with \(y = (x - \langle x \rangle)/\sigma\) normalizing the data. Parameters \(A_{q}\) and \(\sigma_{q}\) depend on \(q\), derived via gamma functions and generalized standard deviations.","All 39 light curves follow Tsallis distributions, with \(q>1\) indicating longer-tailed profiles. For example, the 8 GHz radio light curve fits a \(q\)-Gaussian with \(q=1.60\) (\(R^{2}=0.997\)), whereas Gaussian fits fail to capture fluxes above \(1\sigma\). Two entropy jumps occur in the IR (0.34 eV) and X-ray bands. The IR peak correlates with synchrotron flares and dust thermal radiation, while the X-ray peak is less robust due to data limitations. The entropy-energy relationship is modeled as \(S_{q}=A+B \exp(-E/E_{0})\), with parameters \(A=2.10 \pm 0.92\), \(B=0.01 \pm 0.023\), \(E_{0}=0.65 \pm 0.46\) eV (radio to submillimeter) and \(A=1.91 \pm 2.11\), \(B=9.04 \pm 2.43\), \(E_{0}=0.64 \pm 0.18\) eV (IR to X-ray), yielding correlation coefficients of 0.51 and 0.75. Entropy \(S_{q}\) for hard X-rays and \(\gamma\)-rays could not be calculated due to insufficient data.","The IR entropy jump at 0.34 eV is attributed to synchrotron flares and thermal radiation from hot dust, while the X-ray increase may stem from Comptonization processes. Millimeter-band variability aligns with entropy trends, reflecting synchrotron-dominated flaring. The optical-to-UV range shows weak entropy dispersion, contrasting with rising fractional variability (\(F_{\text{var}}\)) at shorter wavelengths. The X-ray entropy uncertainty arises from poor data quality, complicating distinctions between radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars. Tsallis distributions effectively describe variability except in the IR band, where Gaussian profiles dominate.","This study demonstrates the utility of non-extensive statistical mechanics in analyzing AGN variability. The entropy-energy jumps highlight complex interactions between synchrotron processes, thermal radiation, and flaring activity. The IR peak’s physical significance contrasts with the X-ray peak’s statistical uncertainty, underscoring the need for improved X-ray data. Future work with robust datasets and advanced statistical methods could validate these findings and extend the framework to other astrophysical sources."
2502.03794,The \(\mathbf{G e V},Yuliang Xin et al.,"Supernova remnants (SNRs) are key sites for Galactic cosmic ray (CR) acceleration, with pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) being dynamic structures powered by pulsars. These systems emit across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to \(\gamma\)-rays, through processes like hadronic interactions, inverse Compton scattering, and nonthermal bremsstrahlung. Composite SNR CTB 87, associated with the TeV source VER J2016+371, exhibits a filled-centered morphology dominated by synchrotron emission from a PWN. Radio observations reveal a kidney-shaped structure with spectral steepening above 11 GHz, while X-ray studies identify a diffuse nebula around the putative pulsar CXOU J2016+3711, confirmed as PSR J2016+3711 by FAST. CTB 87’s \(\gamma\)-ray emission, first detected by VERITAS, shows interactions with molecular clouds (MCs), suggesting a composite system with hadronic contributions to \(\gamma\)-ray production.","The study aims to elucidate the nature of \(\gamma\)-ray emission in CTB 87 by distinguishing between hadronic and leptonic processes, confirming its classification as a composite SNR, and identifying the GeV counterpart of VER J2016+371. This addresses gaps in understanding particle acceleration mechanisms and the interplay between SNRs, PWNe, and MCs.","Fermi-LAT Pass 8 data spanning August 4, 2008, to September 4, 2024 (1 GeV–1 TeV) were analyzed, excluding events with zenith angles > \(90^{\circ}\) to minimize Earth Limb contamination. A \(20^{\circ} \times 20^{\circ}\) region centered on CTB 87 (R.A. \(=304^{\circ} .057\), decl. \(=37^{\circ} .213\)) served as the ROI. Data processing used Fermi Science Tools with the IRF ""P8R3_SOURCE_V3"" and binned likelihood analysis. Background models included Galactic diffuse (gll_iem_v07.fits) and isotropic (iso_P8R3_SOURCE_V3_v1.txt) components. Sources from the 4FGL-DR4 catalog within \(20^{\circ}\) were incorporated, with free parameters for sources within \(5^{\circ}\). Spatial analysis employed a \(4^{\circ} \times 4^{\circ}\) Test Statistic (TS) map, revealing three new \(\gamma\)-ray sources (NewPS1–3). Spectral analysis used power-law and log-parabola models, with energy-dependent analyses in low (1–30 GeV) and high (30 GeV–1 TeV) ranges.","Two distinct GeV \(\gamma\)-ray sources were identified: PsA (soft spectrum, index \(2.902 \pm 0.109\)) and PsB (hard spectrum, index \(1.689 \pm 0.232\)). PsA’s integral photon flux is \((2.69 \pm 0.32) \times 10^{-9}\) photon \(\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\), while PsB’s is \((2.21 \pm 1.46) \times 10^{-10}\) photon \(\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\). Energy-dependent analysis showed PsA dominating the low-energy range (TS = 262.83) and PsB the high-energy range (TS = 28.81). The centroids of \(\gamma\)-ray emission in these ranges were \(0^{\circ} .016\) apart, indicating unresolved components. Spectral curvature tests found no significant improvement with log-parabola models. VER J2016+371’s SED aligns with a leptonic model using a broken power-law electron distribution (\(E_{\text{br}} \sim 9 \, \text{GeV}\), \(\gamma_1 \sim 1.5\), \(\gamma_2 \sim 2.8\)) and magnetic field \(B \sim 7 \, \mu\text{G}\).","PsA’s soft spectrum (\(\alpha_p \sim 2.9\)) and total proton energy (\(W_p \sim 5.0 \times 10^{49} \, \text{erg}\)) suggest a hadronic origin from SNR-MC interactions, consistent with systems like IC 443 and W44. PsB’s hard GeV spectrum connects to VER J2016+371’s TeV emission, supporting its identification as a PWN powered by PSR J2016+3711 (\(\dot{E} = 2.2 \times 10^{37} \, \text{erg s}^{-1}\), \(\tau_c = 11.1 \, \text{kyr}\)). The leptonic model for PsB implies a broken power-law electron distribution with \(E_{e,\text{cut}} > 400 \, \text{TeV}\), synchrotron cooling timescales exceeding the pulsar’s age, and a TeV efficiency \(L_{1-10 \, \text{TeV}}/\dot{E} \simeq 0.01\%\), typical of \(\gamma\)-ray PWNe.","The findings classify CTB 87 as a composite SNR with distinct hadronic (PsA) and leptonic (PsB) \(\gamma\)-ray components. Future observations by LHAASO and CTA are critical to resolve unresolved emission, probe the non-detected SNR shock, and refine particle acceleration models. This work advances understanding of SNR-MC interactions and PWN emission mechanisms, highlighting the need for deeper radio and X-ray studies to confirm the relic blast wave hypothesis."
2502.03947,An Elaborate Search for Coherent Pulsations from Intermittent-AMXPs,Mustafa Turan Sağlam et al.,"Intermittent-Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars (Intermittent-AMXPs), such as HETE J1900.1-2455, SAX J1748.9-2021, and Aql X-1, are a subset of Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) that exhibit sporadic X-ray pulsations during outbursts. These systems serve as unique laboratories for studying pulse phenomena, as most LMXBs lack persistent pulsations due to unresolved mechanisms such as weak magnetic fields, gravitational lensing, or Compton scattering. Aql X-1, with a 550.25 Hz pulse detected for only 150 s, has a 19-hour orbital period and cyclic outbursts. HETE J1900.1-2455, discovered in 2005, initially showed 377.3 Hz pulses but later exhibited sporadic pulsations. SAX J1748.9-2021, located in NGC 6440, displays transient 442.3 Hz pulsations, recently detected by XMM-Newton.","The absence of persistent pulsations in most LMXBs remains unexplained, necessitating detailed studies of intermittent-AMXPs to elucidate the physical conditions enabling sporadic pulsations. Understanding these systems could clarify the roles of magnetic field strength, accretion dynamics, and Compton scattering in suppressing or enabling pulsations.","The study analyzed 16 years of RXTE/PCA data in the \(3.0-13.0 \mathrm{keV}\) energy range for three intermittent-AMXPs. Temporal analysis utilized the \(Z_{n}^{2}\) statistic, which processes photon arrival times directly without requiring light curves. The phase \(\Phi(t)\) for each photon was calculated using \(\Phi(t)=2 \pi \cdot \nu \cdot t\), where \(\nu\) is the input frequency. The \(Z_{n}^{2}\) power was computed via:  
\[
Z_{n}^{2}=\frac{2}{N} \sum_{\mathrm{k}=1}^{n}\left[\left(\sum_{\mathrm{j}=1}^{N} \cos k \Phi_{\mathrm{j}}\right)^{2}+\left(\sum_{\mathrm{j}=1}^{N} \sin k \Phi_{\mathrm{j}}\right)^{2}\right]
\]  
The \(3.0-13.0 \mathrm{keV}\) range was selected as optimal for pulsations. Pulse scans used frequency ranges \(550.0-550.5 \mathrm{Hz}\) (Aql X-1), \(336.0-338.0 \mathrm{Hz}\) (HETE J1900.1-2455), and \(441.0-443.0 \mathrm{Hz}\) (SAX J1748.9-2021), with a \(10^{-4} \mathrm{Hz}\) step size. The maximum likelihood (ML) technique refined pulse profiles using phase shifts \(\phi_{\text{off}}\), calculated via \(\operatorname{Prob}(\phi_{\text{off}})=\prod_{i=1}^{N} P_{i}(\phi_{i}-\phi_{\text{off}})\), where \(P_i\) is the normalized pulse profile.","For Aql X-1, 45 out of 111 pulse candidates survived RMS elimination, with durations of 25–109 s. HETE J1900.1-2455 yielded 30 candidates (27–62 s), and SAX J1748.9-2021 showed 21 candidates (26–661 s). ML analysis revealed systematic phase shifts, confirming an \(8.764 \pm 0.001\)-hour orbital period for SAX J1748.9-2021. ML detected slightly longer pulse durations than \(Z_{1}^{2}\), indicating smoother transitions between pulse states. Simulations confirmed detections with chance probabilities of \(1 \times 10^{-5}\) to \(4 \times 10^{-5}\). Three transition patterns (sharp, smooth, intermediate) were linked to accretion regimes and magnetic field orientations.","The longer pulse durations observed with ML suggest smooth transitions between pulse-on and pulse-off states, influenced by inhomogeneous Comptonized coronae and accretion rate variations. The corona’s optical depth may insufficiently suppress pulsations, while thick disc assumptions could explain transitions. Magnetic field strength variations and accretion turbulence likely modulate pulse amplitudes. Phase shift evolution in SAX J1748.9-2021 validated its orbital period, even in \(Z_{1}^{2}\)-null intervals, highlighting ML’s sensitivity.","This study enhances understanding of intermittent-AMXP pulse dynamics, offering insights into orbital parameters and accretion physics. The ML technique’s precision in detecting phase shifts and pulse transitions underscores its utility for future studies of similar systems. The identified transition patterns provide a framework for linking observational data to theoretical models of accretion regimes and magnetic field interactions."
2502.03834,Estimating the evolution and the content fractions of baryonic gas for Luminous Infrared Galaxies,M. N. Al Najm et al.,"Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs), with infrared luminosities of \(10^{11}\) to \(10^{12}\) solar luminosities, are pivotal in understanding galaxy evolution. They derive energy from star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN), with mergers often driving these processes. LIRGs are crucial for studying the relationship between galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and explaining high-redshift quasars.","The study aims to investigate the interplay between gas content, star formation, and galaxy evolution in LIRGs. These galaxies provide insights into gas dynamics, baryonic mass fractions, and the processes governing gas depletion and accretion, which are essential for understanding the evolutionary pathways of galaxies and their connection to SMBHs.","The study analyzed 82 LIRGs using data from SDSS DR17, NED, and HyperLEDA, focusing on morphological types, B-band diameters, H I magnitudes, radial velocities, color filters (g, r-bands), extinction values, inclination angles, line widths, and redshifts. Key parameters, including stellar mass \(M_{\text{star}}\), star formation rate (SFR), dust mass, baryonic mass, and dynamical mass, were calculated. Photometric distance \(D\) was derived using the post-Hubble relation with cosmological constants (\(\Omega_m = 0.308\), \(\Omega_\Lambda = 0.692\), \(q_0 = -0.55\)). Neutral hydrogen mass \(M_{\text{HI}}\) was calculated from 21-cm line flux, corrected for inclination. Dust mass \(M_{\text{dust}}\) was estimated using FIR fluxes at 60 and 100 \(\mu m\), with dust temperature \(T_{\text{dust}}\) derived from their ratio. Dynamical mass \(M_{\text{dyn}}\) was computed from circular velocity \(V_c\), Hi linewidth \(W_{50,\text{HI}}\), and inclination \(i\). Stellar mass \(M^*\) was determined from optical colors and mass-to-light ratios \(\Upsilon^*\), while total gas mass \(M_{\text{gas}}\) included contributions from HI, H\(_2\), and helium. Molecular gas mass \(M_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}\) was approximated as \(0.07 M^{*}\), linked to stellar mass via \(\log M_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}\left(M_{\odot}\right)=\log M^{*, V}-1.16\). Gas depletion time \(\tau_{\text{dep}}\) was calculated as \(M_{\text{gas}} / \mathrm{SFR}\). NGC 7679 was observed using ALMA as a representative LIRG.","The molecular-to-atomic hydrogen gas ratio \(M_{\mathrm{H}_{2}} / M_{\mathrm{H}_{1}}\) correlates with morphological types, gas mass fractions, and galaxy characteristics like color and luminosity. Late-type galaxies (Sd-Sm-Irr) exhibit molecular gas masses five times less than atomic gas, while early-type galaxies (E-S0) show the opposite trend. Dust-to-stellar content ratios decrease as gas is consumed for star formation, while gas mass fraction \(\left(f_{\text{gas}}\right)\) increases with declining stellar mass (correlation coefficient -0.7). Galaxies with high \(f_{\text{gas}}\) either accrete gas rapidly or convert it into stars less efficiently. Gas depletion time \(\tau_{\text{dep}}\) decreases sharply with increasing stellar mass (regression -0.9), with massive galaxies (\(M^{*, V} \geq 10^{10} M_{\odot}\)) having \(\tau_{\text{dep}}\) shorter than the Hubble time. Dust mass (\(M_{\text{dust}} \approx 5.4 \times 10^{6} M_{\odot}\)) correlates with stellar mass and SFR (regression coefficients >0.5), while the dust-to-baryonic mass fraction \(f_{\text{dust,bar}}\) is low (0.00018). Metallicity inversely affects baryonic gas fraction, modeled as \(\phi=1-(y+Z)\), with intergalactic hydrogen fraction \(\eta = \phi^{-1}\) ranging from 1.36 to 1.5.","The scatter in \(M_{\mathrm{H}_{2}} / M_{\mathrm{HI}}\) ratios is attributed to morphological classification challenges and environmental factors. The negative correlation between gas fraction and \((B-V)_{\text{corrected}}\) may result from low SFRs. The flattening of the \(M_{\text{dust}}-M^{*, V}\) relationship at high stellar masses indicates dust loss in massive LIRGs. The strong negative correlation between \(\tau_{\text{dep}}\) and stellar mass suggests massive galaxies are nearing gas depletion, while less massive galaxies retain significant gas reserves. The metallicity-dependent model \(\phi=1-(y+Z)\) highlights the role of stellar mass and gas dynamics in regulating gas evolution.","These results challenge the notion that LIRGs continuously accrete new gas, indicating instead that massive galaxies actively deplete their existing gas supplies. The study underscores the interplay between gas content, star formation efficiency, and galaxy evolution, providing critical insights into the shutdown of star formation in massive LIRGs. The consistency of \(\eta\) with theoretical predictions supports models of baryonic gas evolution influenced by metallicity and stellar mass."
2502.04292,Magnetic Reconnection in a Compact Magnetic Dome: Peculiar Emissions and High-velocity Plasma Flows,J. M. Da Silva Santos et al.,"Small-scale (\(\lesssim 1^{\prime \prime}\)) magnetic reconnection events, such as Ellerman bombs (EBs) and UV bursts (UVBs), are crucial for understanding solar atmospheric dynamics. These transient phenomena, often linked to opposite magnetic polarities, exhibit complex spectral signatures and outflows. Observations suggest diverse configurations, from U-type separatrices to fan-spine topologies, connecting small-scale events to larger flares. Key questions focus on magnetic topology, reconnection mechanisms (e.g., tearing mode instability, turbulent reconnection), and the role of plasmoid-like structures.","This study leverages DKIST data to analyze a small-scale brightening, employing non-LTE inversions and NLFFF extrapolations to explore its atmospheric and magnetic properties. The goal is to investigate the interplay between magnetic topology, energy release, and plasma dynamics, with potential nonthermal particle contributions to multi-wavelength emissions.","DKIST observations of AR NOAA 13465 utilized the Visible Broadband Imager (VBI) and Visible Spectro-Polarimeter (ViSP). VBI captured high-resolution images in G-band, \(\mathrm{H} \beta\), and Ca II K filters. ViSP performed spectropolarimetric raster scans in Fe I 6301/6302 Å, Na I D 5896 Å, and Ca II 8542 Å. Data were processed with speckle algorithms, polarization calibration, and NLTE inversions using the STiC code. Magnetic field extrapolations employed a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) to enforce force-free equations, combining DKIST/ViSP and SDO/HMI data.","The event showed Ellerman bomb-like morphology in \(\mathrm{H} \beta\), annular Ca II K emission (\(\mathrm{FWHM} \sim 0.11^{\prime \prime}\)), and bidirectional flows (downflows \(\sim -18 \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\), upflows \(\sim 28 \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\)). NLTE inversions revealed temperature enhancements (\(\sim 100-2,000 \, \mathrm{K}\)) in the photosphere (\(\log \tau \sim -2\)) and microturbulence peaks (\(\sim 14 \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\)). Magnetic flux cancellation occurred at \(d\Phi/dt \sim 3 \times 10^{15} \, \mathrm{Mx} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\), with energy estimates of \(\sim 10^{27} \, \mathrm{erg}\). NLFFF extrapolations uncovered a low-lying fan-spine configuration (\(\sim 700 \, \mathrm{km}\) height) with a null point and quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs; \(Q \sim 10^{2}-10^{4}\)).","The annular Ca II K structure aligns with a magnetic dome formed during flux cancellation, where reconnection along QSLs drives bidirectional flows and heating. The fan-spine topology explains jet-like structures and plasmoid-like blobs observed in VBI. Temperature enhancements and radiative losses (\(\sim 70 \, \mathrm{kW} \, \mathrm{m}^{-2}\)) suggest nonthermal particle heating, though thermal models fit line profiles. The event’s invisibility in sodium lines and strong \(\mathrm{H} \beta\) emissions may reflect energy deposition differences across atmospheric layers.","The study highlights the role of low-altitude reconnection in shaping multi-wavelength emissions and plasma dynamics. High-cadence, multi-instrument observations are essential to disentangle thermal and nonthermal processes. DKIST’s capabilities advance understanding of magnetic topology-stress relationships, with implications for energy transfer mechanisms in small-scale solar events."
2502.04089,Revisiting symbiotic binaries with interferometry,Jaroslav Merc et al.,"Symbiotic stars, consisting of a cool giant and a compact accretor (typically a white dwarf or neutron star), are ideal for studying mass transfer mechanisms. The dominant process—Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF), stellar wind, or a combination—remains unclear. Radii inferred from spectral types or rotational velocities suggest low Roche-lobe filling factors, but ellipsoidal variability in many systems implies near-full Roche lobes. Interferometric observations combined with Gaia distances offer a potential resolution to this discrepancy. Previous studies have highlighted contradictions between observational signatures and theoretical predictions, particularly regarding evolutionary states and mass transfer efficiency.","This study aims to resolve the ambiguity surrounding mass transfer mechanisms in symbiotic binaries by leveraging high-precision interferometric data and Gaia DR3 distances. The persistent contradiction between Roche-lobe filling factors derived from ellipsoidal variability and those inferred from spectral or rotational properties necessitates a direct observational approach. Understanding whether these systems transfer mass via wind, RLOF, or hybrid mechanisms is critical for modeling binary evolution and accretion physics.","Archival VLTI/PIONIER data (2012–2019) for six symbiotic stars (AG Peg, FG Ser, ER Del, V1261 Ori, RW Hya, and V399 Pav) were reduced using pndrs, yielding squared visibilities and closure phases. Angular diameters were derived using PMOIRED, testing uniform disk and limb-darkened models. The latter employed Claret & Southworth’s power-2 law for limb darkening, providing marginally better fits (reduced \(\chi^{2}\) values). Assumptions included negligible \(H\)-band contributions from companions or circumstellar material. Gaia DR3 parallaxes were used to convert angular to linear radii, with evolutionary tracks from MIST models constraining masses and evolutionary states.","All giants except possibly V399 Pav remain within their Roche lobes, even in systems exhibiting ellipsoidal variability. AG Peg’s M3 giant has \(R_{\mathrm{G}}=151.3_{-7.9}^{+8.7} \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\), filling \(\approx 0.56\) of its Roche lobe at 800 pc. FG Ser’s M5 giant (\(R_{\mathrm{G}}=157.1_{-12.8}^{+14.8} \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\); \(L_{\mathrm{G}}=2959_{-744}^{+1019} \mathrm{L}_{\odot}\)) resides on the AGB with a mass of \(2.0 \pm 0.3 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\). ER Del’s S5.5/2.5 donor (\(R_{\mathrm{G}}=141.5_{-8.9}^{+9.9} \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\)) shows incomplete circularization (\(e=0.28\)). V1261 Ori’s S4.1 giant has conflicting radius estimates: \(R_{\mathrm{G}}=97.8_{-4.5}^{+5.0} \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\) (Gaia) versus \(130.6_{-55.2}^{+96.3} \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\) (Hipparcos), filling 50–75% of its Roche lobe. RW Hya’s M2 giant (\(R_{\mathrm{G}}=106.5_{-7.0}^{+7.8} \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\)) may lie at the RGB tip. V399 Pav’s M5 giant (\(R_{\mathrm{G}}=197.4_{-35.7}^{+48.4} \mathrm{R}_{\odot}\)) could fill its Roche lobe for masses below \(\approx 2.10 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\) at \(i=90^{\circ}\). Rotation is not synchronized in any system, with \(v_{\text{rot}} \sin i\) measurements significantly below synchronized predictions.","The absence of Roche-lobe overflow challenges traditional explanations for ellipsoidal variability, suggesting modified Roche-lobe dynamics influenced by stellar winds, pulsations, or transient mass transfer. Evolutionary tracks and Gaia astrometry indicate most giants are luminous AGB stars, though RW Hya may occupy the RGB tip. Discrepancies in mass ratios derived from He II lines (e.g., AG Peg’s \(q \approx 3\) versus Kenyon et al.’s \(q \approx 4\)) imply overestimations due to line formation mechanisms. The lack of synchronization (\(v_{\text{rot}} \sin i \ll v_{\text{sync}}\)) and circularization in systems like ER Del points to complex mass transfer histories. Gaia’s astrometric limitations for binaries with orbital periods near one year (e.g., RW Hya) exacerbate uncertainties in distance and radius estimates.","These results highlight the limitations of Gaia’s single-star astrometric model for symbiotic binaries, particularly systems with orbital periods close to one year, where parallax deviations up to 1–2 mas can occur. This necessitates cautious interpretation of Gaia data in binary studies. The findings suggest mass transfer predominantly occurs via stellar wind or wind-RLOF rather than classical RLOF, requiring revised models for symbiotic binary evolution. The unresolved cause of ellipsoidal variability in underfilled systems calls for investigations into modified Roche-lobe geometries, dense winds, or transient accretion episodes. Future studies should prioritize spectroscopic follow-up to refine mass ratios and binary parameters, addressing discrepancies in He II line diagnostics."
2502.03833,Properties of the emission region in pulsars with opposite subpulse drift directions in different profile components,H. M. Tedila et al.,"The rotating carousel model explains subpulse drifting as subbeams rotating relative to the line of sight due to \(\boldsymbol{E} \times \boldsymbol{B}\) drift, inferring pulsar parameters like \(\zeta\) and \(\alpha\). However, observations of pulsars such as PSR J0815+0939 reveal bi-drifting subpulses with opposite drift directions across different profile components, challenging the traditional assumption of a singular emission state. These phenomena suggest coexisting emission states with distinct properties, as seen in pulsars exhibiting nulling or phase-dependent emission changes. For example, PSR J1819+1305 shows pulse disappearance in one component while drift patterns change in others, indicating simultaneous operation of different emission states.","The singular emission state assumption in the carousel model fails to explain opposite drift directions and drift-rate switching. This motivates exploring a modified model where plasma flow rates (and thus drift rates) depend on multiple emission states. Understanding these states, parameterized by \(y\), could elucidate mechanisms behind coexisting drift patterns, non-uniform subpulse distributions, and deviations from corotation. The study aims to determine \(y\) from drift parameters, providing insights into emission region properties and the relationship between drifting and non-drifting subpulses.","The model assumes emission from \(m\) discrete overdense plasma areas influenced by \(\boldsymbol{E} \times \boldsymbol{B}\) drift, with the electric field given by:  
\[
\boldsymbol{E}=(1-y \boldsymbol{b} \boldsymbol{b}) \cdot \boldsymbol{E}_{\mathrm{ind}}+(1-y) \boldsymbol{E}_{\mathrm{pot}},
\]  
where \(y \in [0,1]\) represents the emission state. Plasma flow rate is:  
\[
\boldsymbol{v}_{\mathrm{dr}}=\frac{\boldsymbol{E} \times \boldsymbol{B}}{B^{2}}=y \boldsymbol{v}_{\mathrm{ind}}+(1-y) \boldsymbol{v}_{\mathrm{cor}},
\]  
with angular velocity \(\boldsymbol{\omega}_{\mathrm{dr}}=y \boldsymbol{\omega}_{\mathrm{ind}}+(1-y) \boldsymbol{\omega}_{\mathrm{cor}}\). Simulations for PSRs B0525+21, B1929+10, and B0052+51 divide profiles into regions A and B, varying \(m\) (1–45) and \(y\) (0–1) to match observed \(P_2\), \(P_3\), and drift rates. Charge density \(\rho_{\mathrm{sn}}\) is derived using:  
\[
\rho_{\mathrm{sn}}=y \rho_{\min }+(1-y) \rho_{\mathrm{GJ}},
\]  
with \(\rho_{\mathrm{GJ}}=-\varepsilon_{0} \operatorname{div} \boldsymbol{E}_{\mathrm{cor}}\). The visible point’s trajectory depends on \(\zeta\) and \(\alpha\), with emission spots aligned along radial spokes proportional to \(\cos(m\phi_b)\).","Simulations reveal opposite drift directions in all three pulsars, driven by varying \(y\) and \(m\). For PSR B0525+21, \(\omega_{\mathrm{dr}}/\omega_{\text{cor}}\) averages 0.98 (region A) and 1.05 (region B). PSR B0052+51 shows \(\omega_{\mathrm{dr}}/\omega_{\text{cor}}=0.93\) and 1.05, while PSR B1929+10 exhibits 1.14 and 0.89. Drift rate \(P_2/P_3\) reflects these changes, with \(y\) values averaging 0.24, 0.62, and 0.58. Subpulse numbers \(m\) vary (e.g., \(28 \pm 3\) for PSR B0525+21) but show no correlation with \(y\) or \(\alpha\). Charge density \(\rho_{\mathrm{sn}}\) deviates from the Goldreich-Julian value, with non-uniform distribution across emission regions.","Opposite drifting arises from coexisting emission states operating concurrently, where \(y\) varies with azimuthal (\(\phi_b\)) and polar (\(\theta_b\)) angles but not obliquity (\(\alpha\)). Subpulse distribution uniformity depends on pulsar-specific \(D_A/D_B\) ratios: near 1 for PSR B0525+21 (uniform) and unequal for others (non-uniform). Emission states correlate with plasma density \(\rho_{\mathrm{sn}}\) and height \(r\), as \(y\) increases at lower heights in PSRs B1929+10 and B0052+51. Drift-mode switching (e.g., PSR B0031-07) implies time-dependent \(y\), suggesting opposite drifting and mode switching share the same mechanism.","The findings advance understanding of pulsar emission mechanisms by linking opposite drifting to coexisting states in the rotating carousel model. Non-uniform subpulse distributions and \(m\)-independence from \(\alpha\) highlight pulsar-dependent carousel structures. Future telescopes like FAST and SKA may detect more complex drifting patterns, revealing broader prevalence of multiple emission states. The model’s ability to derive emission region properties (e.g., charge density, plasma flow) from \(y\) and \(m\) underscores the role of \(\boldsymbol{E} \times \boldsymbol{B}\) drift in shaping observable subpulse behavior."
